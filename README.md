# COMP4450

**This is just a reference process in a course report, please do not use it for other purposes**
During the literature collection process, I wrote some code to preprocess and filter the search files (they may not be in the same format bib csv txt ......., which will be converted and organized in the code) according to my strategy (It is unrealistic to manually screen the vast number of documents one by one. Unless you select them one by one at the beginning, I think you need to use some keywords to initially screen them.). Just like the PRISMA process. 

The screening results of each stage are saved in a csv file.
