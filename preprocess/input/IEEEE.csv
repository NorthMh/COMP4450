Under dual task walking (DTW) conditions, further degradation in the performance of both the gait and the secondary cognitive task were found in older adults which were significantly correlated to falls history. Cortical control of gait, specifically in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) as measured by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), during DTW in older adults has recently been studied. However, the automatic classification of differences in cognitive activations under single and dual task gait conditions has not been extensively studied yet. In this paper, by considering single task walking (STW) as a lower attentional walking state and DTW as a higher attentional walking state, we aimed to formulate this as an automatic detection of low and high attentional walking states and leverage deep learning methods to perform their classification. We conduct analysis on the data samples which reveals the characteristics on the difference between HbO2 and Hb values that are subsequently used as additional features. We perform feature engineering to formulate the fNIRS features as a 3-channel image and apply various image processing techniques for data augmentation to enhance the performance of deep learning models. Experimental results show that pre-trained deep learning models that are fine-tuned using the collected fNIRS dataset together with gender and cognitive status information can achieve around 81% classification accuracy which is about 10% higher than the traditional machine learning algorithms. We present additional sensitivity metrics such as confusion matrix, precision and  ${F}_{{1}}$  score, as well as accuracy on two-way classification between condition pairings. We further performed an extensive ablation study to evaluate factors such as the voxel locations, channels of input images, zero-paddings and pre-training of deep learning model on their contribution or impact to the classification task. Results showed that using pre-trained model, all the voxel locations, and HbO2 - Hb as the third channel of the input image can achieve the best classification accuracy.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3306365","National Institutes on Aging(grant numbers:R01AG036921,R01AG044007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10224289","Functional near infrared spectroscopy;neural networks;walking tasks classification;deep learning;aging","Task analysis;Legged locomotion;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Older adults;Deep learning;Protocols;Monitoring","Humans;Aged;Deep Learning;Walking;Gait;Algorithms;Benchmarking;Oxyhemoglobins","4","","72","CCBY","18 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hard disk industries, therefore, pay attention to identifying the types and sources of these contaminants. However, expensive analytical procedures are required for precise identification when testing samples are relatively small and scarce. A traditional tool, Raman spectroscopy, provides spectra with poor signal-to-noise ratios when dealing with sub-micron particles. Hence, human experts find noisy Raman spectral identification a real burden. In this study, we proposed a practically applicable pipeline, consisting of a denoising autoencoder with the spectral gradient correlation for the classification task, followed by the novel validation step based on an ensemble of CNN models to remove the predictions with low certainty. In the experiments, three different backbone models for denoising autoencoders are studied, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and U-Net. While the ensemble model consists of eight different CNN models that act as independent machine experts whose votes indicate agreement with the correlation approach. When less agreement is observed, the sample is said to be unidentified and rejected from the classification task. With our validation step, the results bestow exceptionally high classification accuracy of 0.965, 0.955, and 0.976 for spectra undergoing our proposed pipeline with MLP, CNN, and U-Net autoencoder denoising models, respectively.

Because of its advantages of non-destructive and accurate detection, RS is finding more and more use for benign and malignant tissues, tumor differentiation, tumor subtype classification, and section pathology diagnosis, operating either in vivo or in vitro. However, the high specificity of RS comes at a cost. The acquisition rate is low, depth information cannot be directly accessed, and the sampling area is limited. Such limitations can be contained if data pre- and post-processing methods are combined with current methods of Artificial Intelligence (AI), essentially, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). The latter is modifying the approach to cancer diagnosis currently used to automate many cancer data analyses, and it has emerged as a promising option for improving healthcare accuracy and patient outcomes by abiliting prediction diseases tools. In a very broad context, Artificial Intelligence applications in oncology include risk assessment, early diagnosis, patient prognosis estimation, and treatment selection based on deep knowledge. The application of autonomous methods to datasets generated by RS analysis of benign and malignant tissues could make RS a rapid and stand-alone technique to help pathologists diagnose cancer with very high accuracy. This review describes the current milestones achieved by applying AI-based algorithms to RS analysis, grouped according to seven major types of cancers (Pancreatic, Breast, Skin, Brain, Prostate, Ovarian and Oral cavity). Additionally, it provides a theoretical foundation to tackle both present and forthcoming challenges in this domain. By exploring the current achievements and discussing the relative methodologies, this review offers recapitulative insights on recent and ongoing efforts to position RS as a rapid and effective cancer screening tool for pathologists. Accordingly, we aim to encourage future research endeavors and to facilitate the realization of the full potential of RS and AI applications in cancer grading.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3388841","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499825","Raman spectroscopy;cancer diagnosis;artificial intelligence;automated cancer diagnosis;machine learning;deep learning;tumor classification","Cancer;Reviews;Tumors;Microscopy;Fluorescence;Artificial intelligence;Raman scattering","","5","","201","CCBYNCND","15 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Zhou","Information Science and Technology College, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China",IEEE Access,"14 Jan 2025","2025","13","","7746","7756","Raman spectroscopy is an important analytical technique with advantages in non-destructive and rapid analysis, and it is widely used in fields such as chemical analysis, materials science, and biomedical research. The integration of Raman spectroscopy with deep learning methods has been shown to produce excellent chemical analysis results. However, challenges arise when neural networks are faced with issues such as environmental noise and the analysis of samples outside the training dataset, where the reliability and interpretability of the prediction results become critical. Bayesian inference allows for the updating of the hypothesis probability of the neural network’s predictions, thereby incorporating additional evidence and information. To address the issue of uncertainty analysis in Raman spectroscopy predictions, this paper proposes a novel uncertainty analysis method based on the combination of neural networks and Bayesian inference, referred to as BayesianVGG. This method achieves accurate sample classification while quantifying the confidence of the model’s output results through Bayesian inference, significantly enhancing the robustness of Raman spectroscopy analysis in complex environments. In experiments on an animal blood Raman spectroscopy dataset (both reflection and transmission modes), the proposed method achieves classification accuracies of 95.36% and 94.83%, respectively, showing slight improvements over other classical machine learning and neural network methods. Furthermore, by generating prediction confidence heatmaps, BayesianVGG effectively addresses the uncertainty analysis of unknown samples, thereby improving the interpretability of the prediction results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3510927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10777051","Bayesian;Raman spectroscopy;blood analysis;uncertainty analysis","Bayes methods;Uncertainty;Raman scattering;Neural networks;Blood;Training;Noise;Spectroscopy;Feature extraction;Accuracy","","","","40","CCBY","4 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The existing SMC removal methods are mainly based on spectral transformation, but they change the original form of the soil spectrum. In this article, a new deep-learning-based SMC influence removal network (MIRNet) is proposed to establish the relationship between the spectra of moist soil and that of dry soil. This method constructs a spectral extraction module with two 1-D ghost modules to extract soil spectral characteristics and a context extraction module with a two-layer dilated convolutional neural network to extract the context information of the spectra. Then, these extracted features are combined to reconstruct the SMC influence with a two-layer deconvolution using residual learning. Finally, a new loss function that combines spectral distance and spectral shape measurement (D-S loss) is proposed. The input of MIRNet is the moist soil spectra, and the output is the dry soil spectra. Black soil collected from Harbin and yellow-brown soil collected from Nanjing are selected as the research objects.

The framework consists of two main engines. Wavelet transform is proposed as the framework front end for transforming the 1-D noise Raman spectrum to two-dimensional data. The two-dimensional data are fed to the framework back end, which is a classifier. The optimum classifier is chosen by implementing several traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, and we investigate their classification accuracy and robustness performances. The four chosen MLs are naive Bayes (NB), a support vector machine (SVM), a random forest (RF) and a k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) was chosen as a DL classifier. Noise-free, Gaussian noise, baseline noise, and mixed-noise Raman spectra were applied to train and validate the ML and DCNN models. The optimum back-end classifier was obtained by testing the ML and DCNN models with several noisy Raman spectra (10-30 dB noise power). Based on the simulation, the accuracy of the DCNN classifier is 9% higher than that of the NB classifier, 3.5% higher than the RF classifier, 1% higher than the KNN classifier, and 0.5% higher than the SVM classifier. In terms of robustness to mixed noise scenarios, the framework with the DCNN back end showed superior performance compared with the other ML back ends. The DCNN back end achieved 90% accuracy at 3 dB SNR, while the NB, SVM, RF, and K-NN back ends required 27 dB, 22 dB, 27 dB, and 23 dB SNR, respectively. In addition, in the low-noise test dataset, the F-measure score of the DCNN back end exceeded 99.1%, and the F-measure scores of the other ML engines were below 98.7%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3035884","Science, Research and Innovation Promotion Fund(grant numbers:1383848); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9248061","Raman spectrum;baseline noise;wavelet transform;deep convolution neural network;accuracy;robustness","Wavelet transforms;Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Neural networks;Noise measurement;Engines;Signal to noise ratio","","9","","43","CCBY","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are currently no algorithms to predict the entire chemical structure of a broad range of compounds relying solely on IR spectra, unless there is an exact or closely matched spectrum in an existing reference spectra library. To address this, we apply double deep Q-learning for automated prediction of the entire chemical structures of organic compounds based on IR spectra. Our method builds predicted structures by starting from a single carbon atom and subsequently adding an atom and bond step-by-step by ranking the rewards of each possible addition based on Q-values. We devised new structural similarity metrics, atom bond count and substructure count metrics to achieve our goal. Compared to the commonly used structural similarity score, the Jaccard index of extended-connectivity fingerprints, the devised metrics exhibit more suitable properties for Q-learning. The deep Q-model, which uses the combination of our two proposed metrics, gives the overall best performance and can generate structures similar to the actual structures in terms of their structural features and molecular weight in most tested cases.","2691-4581","","10.1109/TAI.2023.3287947","NASA Missouri Space; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10158397","Chemical structure prediction;deep Q-learning;deep learning;infrared spectroscopy;reinforcement learning;structural similarity score","Q-learning;Infrared spectra;Spectroscopy;Deep learning;Reinforcement learning;Chemical analysis","","4","","36","CCBY","20 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In fNIRS analysis, SQC currently relies on applying empirical thresholds to handcrafted Signal Quality Indicators (SQIs). In this study, we use a dataset of fNIRS signals (N = 1,340) recorded from 67 subjects, and manually label the signal quality of a subset of segments (N = 548) to investigate the pitfalls of current practices while exploring the opportunities provided by Deep Learning approaches. We show that SQIs statistically discriminate signals with bad quality, but the identification by means of empirical thresholds lacks sensitivity. Alternatively to manual thresholding, conventional machine learning models based on the SQIs have been proven more accurate, with end-to-end approaches, based on Convolutional Neural Networks, capable of further improving the performance.

As a method yielding non-destructive, pollution-free, and easy-to-obtain data, near-infrared spectroscopy is becoming an important supplement to the detection methods of blended fabrics. In other near-infrared spectroscopy analysis tasks, convolutional neural network is becoming a mainstream model. This study aims to further solve the problems of nonlinearity, sample imbalance, and inaccurate labels in the actual near-infrared spectral dataset of blended fabrics. We first proposed to introduce the convolutional network widely applied in similar tasks to establish a quantitative analysis model of the near-infrared spectroscopy of blended fabrics. Two model variants closely related to the spectral data characteristics are considered: a deeper model and a model with feature attention mechanism. For the sample imbalance problem, a label balancing method based on kernel density estimation is proposed, and for the label noise problem, a noise tolerance method based on absolute error truncation is proposed. Comparative experiments are conducted on eight common blended fabric datasets. The results show that the modeling effect of the convolutional neural network model is generally better than that of traditional machine learning methods, especially the network model that can extract more complex time series data features. Thus, the improvements proposed for the data problem can significantly improve the modeling effect in relevant scenarios.

Hence, monitoring some important blood parameters non-invasively is of utmost importance, that too with high accuracy. This paper presents an in-house developed system, which will be helpful for diabetes patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to monitor blood urea and glucose. This manuscript discusses a comparative study for the prediction of blood urea and glucose using Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP- ANN) and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) model. The NVIDIA Jetson Nano board controls the five fixed LED wavelengths in the Near Infrared (NIR) region from  $2.0~\mu \text{m}$  to  $2.5~\mu \text{m}$  with a constant emission power of 1.2 mW. The spectra for 57 laboratory prepared samples conforming with major blood constituents of the blood sample were recorded. From these samples, 53 spectra were used for training/calibration of the BP-ANN/PLSR model and the remaining 4 samples were used for validating the model. The PLSR model predicts blood urea and glucose with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.88 & 12.01 mg/dL, Coefficient of Determination R2 = 0.93 & R2 = 0.97, Accuracy of 94.2 % and 90.14 %, respectively. To improve the prediction accuracy, BP-ANN model is applied. Later the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was applied to these 57 spectra values. These PCA values were used to train and validate the BP-ANN model. After applying the BP-ANN model, the prediction of blood urea & glucose improved remarkably, which achieved RMSE of 0.69 mg/dL, R2 = 0.96, Accuracy of 95.96 % for urea and RMSE of 2.06 mg/dL, R2 = 0.99, and Accuracy of 98.65 % for glucose.

Those regulations imply, among other aspects, that medicinal product manufacturers have to ensure that the final products are fit for their intended use and do not place patients at risk due to the inadequate safety, quality, or efficacy. For the case of manufacturing of pharmaceutical blisters, the attainment of this quality objective often leads to the resourcing of qualified personnel for final visual verification of the blister pack content. The need for inline content verification of pharmaceutical blisters asks therefore for sensors that provide fast, noncontact, and accurate chemical information of each individual blister content. Here, we report on a quantum cascade laser (QCL)-based blister-verification sensor. The verification principle is substance chemical identification by means of backscattering mid-infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The light source is a palm-size wavelength-tunable mid-IR QCL with  $\sim $ 1-kHz tuning speed. The blister content verification uses machine vision to obtain the required position information for each individual content and fast spatial scanning facilitated by a two-axis galvanometer scanner. Diffuse reflectance mid-IR spectra are acquired at each location, and their classification is conducted instantaneously. Different classifier approaches are evaluated and discussed including machine learning and standard cross correlation to Fourier-transform-IR (FTIR) data. Altogether, this sensor is capable of scanning a standard 12-pill blister pack in  $\sim $ 0.3 s, whereas this scanning time is essentially related to the desired classification accuracy, but not to the spectral resolution, which is fixed. Using machine learning classification, 100% identification accuracy is demonstrated for 13 different medication types (i.e., with different chemical nature), whereas only 97.4% identification accuracy is achieved by standard cross correlation to FTIR data. The used pills have all similar size, shape, and color, so that classification by visual inspection is barely possible.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3281972","Internal Research Funding of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft e.V; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10145064","Chemical verification of pharmaceuticals;laser spectroscopy;mid-infrared (IR) spectroscopy;noncontact chemical verification;point-of-interest (POI) spectroscopy","Quantum cascade lasers;Sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Chemicals;Belts;Measurement by laser beam;Visualization","","2","","25","CCBY","6 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We evaluate the performance of neural network classifiers as well as different dimensionality reduction techniques, with the aim of categorizing lamb fat by means of spectroscopy and analyzing the features with more discrimination power. Assessing the stability of feature ranking algorithms also becomes particularly important. We assess six feature selection techniques (χ2, Information Gain, Gain Ratio, Relief and two embedded techniques based on the decision rule 1R and SVM (Support Vector Machine). Additionally, we compare them with common approaches in the chemometrics field like the Partial Least Square (PLS) model and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) regression. Experimental results with a fat sample dataset collected from carcasses of suckling lambs show that performing feature selection contributes to classification performance increasing accuracy from 89.70% with the full feature set to 91.80% and 93.89% with the SVM approach and PCA, respectively. Moreover, the neural classifiers yield a significant increase in the accuracy with respect to the PLS model (85.60% accuracy). It is noteworthy that unlike PCA or PLS, the feature selection techniques that select relevant wavelengths allow the user to identify the regions in the spectrum with the most discriminant power, which makes the understanding of this process easier for veterinary experts.

To overcome this, we attempted to improve the multipoint performance of wavelength-division multiplexing by using multiple FBGs of the same wavelength. However, it is difficult to analyze the peak wavelengths of individual FBGs using a high-speed wavelength-swept laser because the optical spectra of FBGs at the same wavelength are observed to occur in a complex overlapping manner on the microsecond order. Here, we present a peak-detection method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) in deep learning as a breakthrough in solving this problem. The experiment combines a high-speed wavelength-swept laser and a CNN to achieve high-speed measurement of three overlapping FBGs at the same wavelength. The results demonstrate that a measurement rate of 50 kHz and a wavelength resolution of 4.2 pm can be achieved, improving the limit of wavelength-division multiplexing by a factor of three.

Previous researchers utilized biosignal data such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy and an electroencephalogram to reflect neural variation in factors related to learning ability. Additionally, machine learning algorithms have been used to identify the inherent associations between learning ability and related factors. Herein, we propose a classification framework for college scholastic ability test levels using unsupervised features extracted from a functional near-infrared spectroscopy signal dataset based on machine learning models. To extract unsupervised features from functional near-infrared spectroscopy signals, we constructed a one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with an electroencephalogram dataset as a transfer learning approach. Eight handcrafted features (signal mean, slope, minimum, peak, skewness, kurtosis, variance, and standard deviation) with various window length conditions were calculated to compare influences on classification performance. Five evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve) were applied to evaluate the proposed framework’s performance. Among the five classification algorithms (XGBoost classifier, support vector classifier, naive Bayes classifier, decision tree classifier, and logistic regression), the XGBoost classifier was the best at classifying college scholastic ability test levels. We found that unsupervised features extracted from deep learning algorithms are more usable for classification than handcrafted features. Furthermore, the applicability of transfer learning between two different neural modals was validated using the experimental results. The results of this study provide new insights into the relationships between hemodynamics in functional near-infrared spectroscopy signals and college scholastic ability test levels.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3173629","Yonsei Signature Research Cluster Program of 2021(grant numbers:2021-22-0005); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korea Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)](grant numbers:2019R1A2C1007399); Seoul Research and Development Program(grant numbers:BT190004); Ministry of Education; NRF(grant numbers:2020S1A5A2A03042694); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9771248","College scholastic ability test;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;learning ability;machine learning;transfer learning","Feature extraction;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Task analysis;Electroencephalography;Classification algorithms;Transfer learning;Brain modeling","","1","","79","CCBY","9 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Neuroimaging techniques can be used to map the functioning of the cortex to capture brain activation patterns. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a neuroimaging technique increasingly used for task classification based on brain activation patterns. fNIRS can be widely used in population studies due to the technology’s economic,non-invasive, and portable nature. The multidimensional and complex nature of fNIRS data makes it ideal for deep learning algorithms for classification. Most deep learning algorithms need a large amount of data to be appropriately trained. Generative networks can be used in such cases where a substantial amount of data is required. Still, the collection is complex due to various constraints. Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) can generate artificial samples of a specific category to improve the deep learning classifier’s accuracy when the sample size is insufficient. The proposed system uses an LSTM based CGAN with an LSTM classifier to enhance the accuracy through data augmentation. The system can determine whether the subject’s task is a Left Finger Tap, Right Finger Tap, or Foot Tap based on the fNIRS data patterns. The authors obtained a task classification accuracy of 90.2% for the LSTM based GAN combination.Clinical relevance— Acquiring medical data present practical difficulties due to time, money, labor, and economic cost. The deep learning-based model can better perform medical image classification than hand-crafted features when dealing with many data. GAN-based networks can be valuable in the medical field where collecting extensive data is not feasible.

First, the data used in the experiments was collected by a fiber optic Raman system. A total of 44 tissues of 22 patients were collected for Raman spectroscopy, with TSCC and adjacent normal tissues each accounting for half. The spectral data range used in the model from a full spectrum of 600-4000 cm-1. Then, the ensemble CNN model was used in the experiment. By using two convolution kernels, the model is able to extract nonlinear feature representations from different spectral regions. It has two advantages, on the one hand, it reduces the generation of noise, on the other hand, it obtains a stronger distinguishing ability. Finally, a feature vector is formed by the fusion layer, and is sent to the fully connected layer for the TSCC classification task. The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the model were 99.2% and 99.2%, respectively.

However, this approach is not easy to achieve high classification accuracy because of physiological noises in brain signals. It is also likely to overlook the process of evaluating the reliability of calculated classification accuracy. To solve these problems, we proposed a memristor-based CNN (M-CNNs) This model's weight update process involves using stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), where the normalized conductances of memristors are used as weight substitutes. These conductances are then adjusted to classify stress states. We calculated the classification accuracies between the control and stress groups by using the M-CNNs, and then compared them with those of the CNNs. We used DenseNet, the most recent CNN model, to simulate accuracy under the same conditions. To ensure a fair comparison, we divided the DenseNet into the memristor-based DenseNet (M-DenseNet) and the conventional DenseNet (C-DenseNet). As a result, we discovered that the accuracy of M-CNNs (93.33%) exceeded that of CNNs (87.50%), and is reliable by precision, recall, and F-Score calculated from a confusion matrix. Likewise, M-DenseNet (92.38%) has higher accuracy than C-DenseNet (90.00%), but shows lower accuracy than M-CNNs. Moreover, we observed the reproducibility of M-CNN/DenseNet in various datasets.

However, a considerable fraction of such spectra, which are also valuable for astronomical research, are of low quality, possessing characteristics such as low signal-to-noise ratio (low-S/N). Principal component analysis is widely used to process these low-S/N spectra, but it is not efficient enough to describe the non-linear properties within the spectra. Wavelets are often used to denoise the low-S/N spectra. However, as is well known, the most optimal wavelet basis for each type of spectra needs to be determined; therefore, wavelet analysis is very difficult to use in practice. Restricted Boltzmann machine is a non-linear algorithm that performs poorly when applied to low-S/N spectra. Denoising Convolutional Neural Networks (DnCNN) is a promising denoiser, however, its performance is unsatisfactory due to the lack of suitable noise model. To better exploit the spectra with low-S/N, we propose a new method that can be used to obtain better denoised spectra when compared to those obtained using other methods. A new method called the Spectra Generative Adversarial Nets (Spectra-GANs) is introduced. Spectra-GANs is simply a feedforward neural network that learns the difference between the input vector and the target by minimizing the loss function. It can be used in spectral denoising. The performance of Spectra-GANs is better than those of other methods with regard to denoising the spectra, especially with regard to extremely low-S/N spectral processing. Thus, Spectra-GANs proposed herein is a suitable alternative to previously used methods in spectral denoising.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3000174","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11873037,U1931209,11603012,11803016); Young Scholars Program of Shandong University, Weihai(grant numbers:2016WHWLJH09); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2015M571124); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109312","Stellar spectra;machine learning;denoising","Noise reduction;Gallium nitride;Principal component analysis;Generators;Telescopes;Signal to noise ratio;Convolutional neural networks","","7","","44","CCBY","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For domain barriers, we propose a general and scalable vision fNIRS framework that converts multi-channel fNIRS signals into multi-channel virtual images using the Gramian angular difference field (GADF). We use the framework to train state-of-the-art visual models from computer vision (CV) within a few minutes, and the classification performance is competitive with the latest fNIRS models. In cross-validation experiments, visual models achieve the highest average classification results of 78.68% and 73.92% on mental arithmetic and word generation tasks, respectively. Although visual models are slightly lower than the fNIRS models on unilateral finger- and foot-tapping tasks, the F1-score and kappa coefficient indicate that these differences are insignificant in subject-independent experiments.

Therefore, it is important to use an early detection system that is simple, non-invasive, and automated. Children with ADHD also suffer from other coexisting one or more disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), etc and it creates more challenges to detect ADHD children. Very few researchers considered such kinds of these comorbidities in their studies to detect ADHD for children. In this work, we proposed a deep learning (DL)-based algorithm to identify ADHD children with coexisting ASD. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs) signals from thirteen ADHD children who have coexisting ASD and fifteen typically developing (TD) children were recorded during the drawing of handwriting patterns. We asked each child to draw periodic lines (PL) and zigzag lines (ZL) under the predict and trace condition and repeated them three times. Finally, a hybrid approach was designed by combining convolutional neural networks (CNN) and bidirectional long short-time memory (Bi-LSTM) to determine children with ADHD who have ASD.

In general, measuring a specific property in multibody structures presents a significant challenge due to the complex overlapping peaks within the resonance spectrum. We present a technique for extracting useful features from a complex spectrum by isolating resonance peaks that are sensitive to the measured property and insensitive to other properties (noise peaks). We isolate specific peaks by selecting frequency regions of interest and performing wavelet transformation, where the frequency regions and wavelet scales are tuned via a genetic algorithm. This contrasts greatly from the traditional wavelet transformation/decomposition techniques, which use a large number of wavelets at different scales to represent the signal, including the noise peaks, and results in a large feature size, thus decreasing machine learning (ML) generalizability. We provide a detailed description of the technique and demonstrate the feature extraction technique, for example, regression and classification problems. We observe reductions of 95% and 40% in regression and classification errors, respectively, when using the genetic algorithm/wavelet transform feature extraction, compared to using no feature extraction, or using wavelet decomposition, which is common in optical spectroscopy. The feature extraction has potential to significantly increase the accuracy of spectroscopy measurements based on a wide range of ML techniques. This would have significant implications for ARS, as well as other data-driven methods for other types of spectroscopy, e.g., optical.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2023.3278494","Laboratory Directed Research and Development program of Los Alamos National Laboratory(grant numbers:20220495MFR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130299","Acoustic resonance spectroscopy (ARS);data-driven spectroscopy;machine learning (ML);spectral feature extraction","Feature extraction;Acoustics;Spectroscopy;Frequency measurement;Acoustic measurements;Transducers;Frequency control","Wavelet Analysis;Algorithms;Spectrum Analysis;Machine Learning","1","","26","CCBY","22 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The destructive method uses Lactoscan for comprehensive qualitative measurements, including temperature, pH, conductivity, solids, protein, density, fat content, and SNF. The non-destructive method utilizes hyperspectral imaging (HSI) with the Specim Fx-10 (397–1003 nm) for image-based analysis, involving preprocessing steps like image scaling, ROI selection, radiometric correction, and spectral reflectance extraction using the empirical line method (ELM). Advanced deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), are employed to predict and classify pure and adulterated milk spectra.

Our study proposes using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) combined with multiple machine learning models to assess the level of mental stress. Objective: The objective is to identify and quantify stress levels during 240 days confinement scenario. In this study, we utilize a diverse set of stress indicators including salivary alpha amylase (sAA) levels, reaction time (RT) to stimuli, accuracy of target detection, and power spectral density (PSD), in conjunction with functional connectivity networks (FCN). We estimate the PSD using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the FCN using partial directed coherence. Results: Our findings reveal several intriguing insights. The sAA levels increased from the first 30 days in confinement to the culmination of the lengthy 240-day mission, suggesting a cumulative impact of stress. Conversely, RT and the accuracy of target detection exhibit significant fluctuations over the course of the mission. The power spectral density shows a significant increase with time-in-mission across all participants in most of the frontal area. The FCN shows a significant decrease in most of the right frontal areas. Five different machine learning classifiers are employed to differentiate between two levels of stress resulting in impressive classification accuracy rates: 96.44% with-nearest neighbor (KNN), 95.52% with linear discriminant analysis (LDA), 88.71% with Naïve Bayes (NB), 87.41 with decision trees (DT) and 96.48% with Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The large amount of spectra obtained by the large sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are rich sources of these rare objects. However, a considerable fraction of these spectra are low-S/N spectra. These low-S/N spectra contain similar useful information as the high-S/N spectra, and making better use of these spectra can significantly improve the chance of finding rare objects. Nevertheless, little research has been done on them. In this study we propose a novel method based on the combination of PCA (Principal Components Analysis) and CFSFDP (Clustering by Fast Search and Find of Density Peak) to search for rare objects from low-S/N spectra. The PCA first extracts principal components from high-S/N spectra to generate general feature spectra and reconstructs low-S/N stellar spectra with these general feature spectra. Then the CFSFDP calculates the Local Density ρ and the Distance δ of the reconstructed spectra, and select the outliers through the decision graph quickly and accurately. We first apply our method to spectra in SDSS stellar classification template library with adding white gaussian noise to search for rare objects (carbon stars, carbon white dwarfs, carbon_lines, white dwarfs and white dwarfs magnetic). Then we apply our method to observed spectra with different low-S/Ns from SDSS and compared with Lick-index+K-means and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Our proposed algorithm includes a custom inter-subject variability reduction based on the principal component analysis (PCA). The principal components of extracted features are first identified for non-responders’ group. The first few components that sum up to 99% of explained variance are discarded to minimize inter-subject variability while the remaining projection vectors are applied on all response groups (24 non-responders, 15 partial-responders, 13 responders) to obtain their relative projections in feature space.

This review aims to analyze various aspects of sugar production, including sugar prediction, processing techniques, and sugarcane quality parameters, and focuses on the use of sugarcane juice parameters to construct predictive models. Predicting the sugar content in sugarcane is crucial for optimizing agricultural practices, harvesting schedules, and processing operations in the sugar industry, including jaggery and white sugar production. Researchers have explored several methodologies and techniques for accurately predicting the sugar content of sugarcane prior to harvesting. The present analysis highlights that conventional regression algorithms can predict sugar content;however, multicollinearity restricts their effectiveness. To improve prediction accuracy and overcome existing limitations, future research should concentrate on developing advanced models that mitigate multicollinearity. In the existing research, it is difficult for users to comprehend the output of sugar prediction values. In the sugar industry, buyers and sellers typically measure sugarcane in metric tons, whereas sugar manufacturers typically measure sugar in kilograms. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze sugarcane juice parameters and develop a machine-learning model based on these data.

The qualitative spectroscopic technique provides a better solution for detecting the toxic contents of milk and foodstuffs. All the available spectroscopic methods for milk adulterant detection are based on laboratory-based with costly equipment. This laboratory-based detection takes a long time and is more expensive, which may not be afforded by a common man. To overcome this issue, this research work involves the design and development of a low-cost, portable, multispectral, AI-based, non-destructive spectroscopic sensor system that can be used to detect the milk adulterant in real-time. The designed sensor system uses the spectroscopic method with wavelength ranges from (410-940nm) which consists of three different bands Ultraviolet (UV), visible, and Infra-Red(IR) spectrum to improve the accuracy of detection. The sensor system is connected to the internet via the developed IoT application module, which displays the detected adulterant results in a dedicated web page designed for this purpose.

"Quantitative Formula of Blink Rates-Pupillometry for Attention Level Detection in Supervised Machine Learning","F. Zennifa; K.

Numerous methods of attention level detection such as observation, self-assessment, and objective performance have been applied especially in supervised machine learning. But those methods tend to be delayed, sporadic, not at the moment in time, and based on participant cognitive ability. This study proposed a new labeling method for attention level detection by using quantitative evaluation formula based on blink rates and pupillometry. Comparison in error detection between self-assessment, observation, and objective performance has been done in this study. After that, this study investigated the effect of attention level based on self-assessment toward blink rates and pupillometry. The result shown blink rates in low attention is higher than high attention. On the other hand, pupillometry in low attention is smaller than high attention. The effect of attention levels toward pupillometry and blink rates are extracted into several algorithms. The result from experimental procedure shown quantitative evaluation formula has percentage error less than 15% compared with self-assessment. Overall, these results demonstrated that the proposed method can be used to be data labeling for other physiological signals such as electroencephalograph (EEG), electrocardiograph (ECG), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). After that, this quantitative formula was applied to EEG-ECG-NIRS for attention level detection. Two-electrode wireless EEG, a wireless ECG, and two wireless channels NIRS has been used to detect attention level during tasks load.

Aiming at identifying different types of oil spills, this article analyses the reflectance spectra obtained from high-resolution hyperspectral sensors using multiple machine learning methods. Four types of machine learning models are applied in this article: random forest; support vector machine (SVM); and deep neural network (DNN); and DNN with differential pooling (DP-DNN).

Bimodal data acquisition protocols combining the temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) with the spatial resolution of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) require novel approaches to decoding. Methods: We present an EEG-fNIRS Hybrid BCI that employs a new bimodal deep neural network architecture consisting of two convolutional sub-networks (subnets) to decode overt and imagined speech. Features from each subnet are fused before further feature extraction and classification. Nineteen participants performed overt and imagined speech in a novel cue-based paradigm enabling investigation of stimulus and linguistic effects on decoding. Results: Using the hybrid approach, classification accuracies (46.31% and 34.29% for overt and imagined speech, respectively (chance: 25%)) indicated a significant improvement on EEG used independently for imagined speech (p = 0.020) while tending towards significance for overt speech (p = 0.098). In comparison with fNIRS, significant improvements for both speech-types were achieved with bimodal decoding (p<0.001). There was a mean difference of ∼12.02% between overt and imagined speech with accuracies as high as 87.18% and 53%. Deeper subnets enhanced performance while stimulus effected overt and imagined speech in significantly different ways. Conclusion: The bimodal approach was a significant improvement on unimodal results for several tasks. Results indicate the potential of multi-modal deep learning for enhancing neural signal decoding. Significance: This novel architecture can be used to enhance speech decoding from bimodal neural signals.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2021.3132861","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/T022175/1); UKRI Turing AI Fellowship; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/V025724/1); Department for the Economy, Northern Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9640517","Electroencephalography;EEG;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;fNIRS;brain-computer interfaces;imagined speech;deep learning;bimodal deep learning","Decoding;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Production;Deep learning;Linguistics","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Deep Learning;Electroencephalography;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer;Speech","15","","73","CCBY","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, only a few imaging spectrometer missions are currently in operation. Aiming to generate synthetic satellite-based hyperspectral imagery potentially covering any region, we explored the possibility of applying statistical learning, i.e., emulation. Based on the relationship of a Sentinel-2 (S2) scene and a hyperspectral HyPlant airborne image, this work demonstrates the possibility to emulate a hyperspectral S2-like image. We tested the role of different machine learning regression algorithms and varied the image-extracted training dataset size. We found superior performance of neural network as opposed to the other algorithms when trained with large datasets (up to 100 000 samples). The developed emulator was then applied to the L2A (bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance) S2 subset, and the obtained S2-like hyperspectral reflectance scene was evaluated. The validation of emulated against reference spectra demonstrated the potential of the technique. $R^{2}$ values between 0.75 and 0.9 and NRMSE between 2 and 5% across the full 402–2356 nm range were obtained. Moreover, epistemic uncertainty is obtained using the dropout technique, revealing spatial fidelity of the emulated scene. We obtained highest SD values of 0.05 (CV of 8%) in clouds and values below 0.01 (CV of 7%) in vegetation land covers. Finally, the emulator was applied to an entire S2 tile (5490 × 5490 pixels) to generate a hyperspectral reflectance datacube with the texture of S2 (60 Gb, at a speed of 0.14 s/10000 pixels). As the emulator can convert any S2 tile into a hyperspectral image, such scenes give perspectives how future satellite imaging spectroscopy will look like.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3231380","European Research Council(grant numbers:755617); European Space Agency; Ramón y Cajal Contract; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996580","Emulation;hyplant;hyperspectral;neural networks (NNs);Sentinel-2 (S2)","Artificial neural networks;Hyperspectral imaging;Training;Uncertainty;Kernel;Neurons;Predictive models","","4","","47","CCBY","22 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A significant advantage of SSC-ASS is that it does not require manual labeling of every abnormal data, but instead achieves high-precision classification of ASSs using only a small number of labeled data. Furthermore, the method can to some extent avoid the introduction of erroneous information resulting from the complex and variable nature of abnormal signals, thereby improving classification accuracy. Specifically, SSC-ASS uses a memory AutoEncoder module to efficiently extract features from abnormal spectrum signals by learning from the reconstruction error. Additionally, SSC-ASS combines convolutional neural network and the $K$-means using a DeepCluster framework to fully utilize the unlabeled data. Furthermore, SSC-ASS also utilizes pre-training, category mean memory module and replaces pseudo-labels to further improve the classification accuracy of ASSs.

However, recruiting sufficient subjects is challenging owing to time and budget constraints. Therefore, we propose an NIRS data generation algorithm that scales NIRS signal components, such as hemodynamic response function, physiological systemic noise, and instrumental spike noise, based on the source-detector distance to augment the training data. Experimental self-paced left- and right-hand motor imagery data were augmented with generated NIRS data to train a convolutional neural network and classify the motor imagery data. Augmenting the training dataset with 1000 generated data increased the classification accuracy to 86.3 ± 4.1%, a 26% increase compared with training on experimental data only.

Written self-report anxiety measures are available; however, these indices tend to be time consuming to acquire. For medical patients, completing written reports can be burdensome if they are weak, in pain, or in acute anxiety states. Consequently, simple and fast non-invasive methods for assessing stress response from neurophysiological data are essential. In this paper, we report on a study that makes predictions of the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) index from oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentration changes of the prefrontal cortex using a two-channel portable near-infrared spectroscopy device. Predictions are achieved by constructing machine learning algorithms within a Bayesian framework with nonlinear basis function together with Markov Chain Monte Carlo implementation. In this paper, prediction experiments were performed against four different data sets, i.e., two comprising young subjects, and the remaining two comprising elderly subjects. The number of subjects in each data set varied between 17 and 20 and each subject participated only once. They were not asked to perform any task; instead, they were at rest. The root mean square errors for the four groups were 6.20, 6.62, 4.50, and 6.38, respectively. There appeared to be no significant distinctions of prediction accuracies between age groups and since the STAI are defined between 20 and 80, the predictions appeared reasonably accurate. The results indicate potential applications to practical situations such as stress management and medical practice.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2014.2361757","Grant-in-Aid through the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Sciences, and Technology, Japan(grant numbers:B23300247); Alpha Electron Company, Ltd., Fukushima, Japan; Iing Company, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6917199","Anxiety index;Blood oxygenation;Health and safety;Near Infrared spectroscopy;Neuronal activity;Oxyhemoglobin;Prediction methods;Prevention medicine;Regional cerebral blood flow;Translational engineering;Anxiety index;blood oxygenation;health and safety;near infrared spectroscopy;neuronal activity;oxyhemoglobin;prediction methods;prevention medicine;regional cerebral blood flow;translational engineering","Prediction algorithms;Indexes;Stress;Bayes methods;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Educational institutions","","7","","33","OAPA","8 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper demonstrates the development of a neural-network-based model for discriminating between diverse neutron energy spectrum sources via acoustic analysis of shock signals resulting from cavitation detection events (CDEs) within centrifugal tensioned metastable fluid detectors (CTMFDs). Acoustic shock traces from CDEs were recorded using the Cf-252 (Cf) fission spectrum source, the plutonium-beryllium (PuBe) hard spectrum ( $\alpha $ ,n) source, and the deuterium-tritium (DT) accelerator-driven monoenergetic 14 MeV neutron source which provided neutrons of diverse energy spectrums spanning 0.02 eV to 14 MeV. The resultant time-series voltage signals were then transformed into spectrograms to reveal the distribution of acoustic power across the frequency and time domains. More than 42,000 spectrograms were produced. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to classify the spectrograms according to the neutron source they originated from. This model separated the Cf-252 and DT neutron sources with ~96% accuracy, the Cf-252 and PuBe sources with ~98% accuracy, and the PuBe and DT sources with ~90% accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3539174","U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Nuclear Education Program, Purdue University, IN, USA, and the U.S. DOE’s Nuclear Safety Research and Development Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10872969","Acoustic analysis;convolutional neural networks;fluid metastability;machine learning;neutron spectrometry","Neutrons;Fluids;Detectors;Acoustics;Spectroscopy;Electric shock;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Acoustic measurements;Sensitivity","","","","30","CCBY","4 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hyperspectral information in 10 hours before the germination of four vigor level seeds (144 samples each) was collected.

While these EVs are highly purified and homogeneous compared to complex samples, the ability to classify them from a single species demonstrates the incredible power of SERS when combined with machine learning, and the importance of considering these parameters in future applications.

Recent researches indicate that functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based on deep learning provides a promising approach to depression diagnosis. However, collecting large fNIRS datasets within a standard experimental paradigm remains challenging, limiting the applications of deep networks that require more data. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an fNIRS-driven depression recognition architecture based on cross-modal data augmentation (fCMDA), which converts fNIRS data into pseudo-sequence activation images. The approach incorporates a time-domain augmentation mechanism, including time warping and time masking, to generate diverse data. Additionally, we design a stimulation task-driven data pseudo-sequence method to map fNIRS data into pseudo-sequence activation images, facilitating the extraction of spatial-temporal, contextual and dynamic characteristics. Ultimately, we construct a depression recognition model based on deep classification networks using the imbalance loss function. Extensive experiments are performed on the two-class depression diagnosis and five-class depression severity recognition, which reveal impressive results with accuracy of 0.905 and 0.889, respectively.

This study proposes a novel two-stage machine learning strategy for retrieving 2-D directional wave spectra from Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR wave mode products. We achieve the generation of complete 2-D wave spectra and several wave parameters solely from GF-3 SAR data without necessitating any additional inputs. In the first stage, we employ the Energy Attention Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (EA-CGAN) to retrieve the normalized wave spectrum. The generator of the EA-CGAN establishes a nonlinear transformation from normalized SAR cross spectra to normalized wave spectra to enhance the capabilities. In the second stage, the XGBoost model retrieves the intensity of the wave spectrum. The EA-CGAN and XGBoost models were trained on an extensive dataset that consists of about 11 000 Gaofen-3 SAR wave mode imagettes and 2-D wave spectra from the fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA-5) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The results of the evaluation using test samples reveal high consistency between the retrieved wave spectra and ERA-5 wave spectra in terms of spectral similarity, peak period, peak direction, significant wave height, and mean wave periods.

However, existing methods for soil texture classification rely on soil images taken under controlled conditions, which are not scalable for high spatiotemporal mapping of soil texture and fail to reflect real-world challenges and variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, scalable, and high spatial resolution soil surface texture classification process that employs image processing, texture-enhancing filters, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify soil images captured under Uncontrolled Field Conditions (UFC). The proposed process involves a series of steps for improving soil image analysis. Initially, image segmentation is utilized to eliminate non-soil pixels and prepare the images for further processing. Next, the segmented output is divided into smaller tiles to isolate relevant soil pixels. Then, high-frequency filtering is introduced to enhance the texture of the images. Our research has shown that the Gabor filter is more effective than Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for this purpose. By creating four distinct Gabor filters, we can enhance specific, hidden patterns within the soil images. Finally, the split and enhanced images are used to train CNN classifiers for optimal analysis. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework using different metrics and compare it to existing state-of-the-art soil texture classification frameworks. Our proposed soil texture classification process improves performance. We employed various CNN architectures in our proposed process for comparison purposes. Inception v3 produces the highest accuracy of 85.621%, an increase of 12% compared to other frameworks. With applications in precision agriculture, soil management, and environmental monitoring, the proposed novel methodology has the potential to offer a dependable and sustainable tool for classifying soil surface texture using low-cost ground imagery acquired under UFC.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3290907","Croptimistic Technology Inc., Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and MITACS; NSERC Discovery Grant through the Crop Stress Management Using Multi-Source Data Fusion(grant numbers:RGPIN-2021-04171); NSERC Alliance Grant through the Ground Truth Validation of Crop Growth Cycle Using High-Resolution Proximal and Remote Sensing(grant numbers:ALLRP 549723-19); MITACS Accelerate through the Estimating Organic Matter, Soil Surface Roughness, Plant Stand Count, and Inter-Plant Spacing from High-Resolution RGB Imagery(grant numbers:IT27704); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10168088","Soil texture classification;image processing;convolutional neural network;uncontrolled field conditions;Gabor filter;texture enhancement","Classification;Soil texture;Gabor filters;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Surface texture;Soil measurements;Image processing;Convolutional neural networks","","8","","62","CCBYNCND","28 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network in deep learning has been validated to have strong capability of solving time series problems. In this paper, we develop a spectrum prediction framework with a deep learning approach on two real-world spectrum datasets. For the first dataset to predict channel occupancy states, we firstly employ the taguchi method to determine the best optimized configuration of neural network for certain spectrum point and then analyze the effect of each design hyper-parameter. Next, we build LSTM neural networks with two perspectives of regression and classification for spectrum prediction. For the second dataset to predict channel quality, we compare the prediction performance of the LSTM neural network and conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. For both of our datasets, results show that the prediction performance varies with frequency bands. From the point of statistics, the LSTM neural network has better prediction performance than the MLP neural network and is more stable as well.

First, the wavelengths, OSNRs, and bandwidths of optical signals are processed by four ML methods based on the spectral data. The good performance and fast processing speed are obtained, especially for SVM, achieving the optimal accuracy (100%) and the least test time.

In addition, the extended analysis functions are also studied to diagnose the spectral distortion caused by the cascaded filtering effect and off-center filtering effect. The number of cascaded filters and the offsets of filter shift and laser drift can be effectively estimated by the SVM with high average accuracy and low standard deviation, which are useful for failure detection and distortion recovery.

Further, a spectroscopy device is limited by its memory size, computing power, and battery capacity. That requires highly efficient learning models for on-site analysis. In this paper, by analyzing multi-gas mixtures and multi-molecule suspensions, we first show that orders of magnitude reduction of data dimension can be achieved as the number of principal components that need to be retained is the same as the independent constituents in the mixture. From this principle, we designed highly compact models in which the essential principal components can be directly extracted from the interrelations between the individual chemical properties and principal components; and only a few training samples are required.

Extraction of effective features and accurate classification of signals have always been the focus of research. Previous studies have often converted fNIRS data into images based on the relative positions of the measurement channels and utilized convolutional neural networks (CNN) for classification. However, image representation cannot fully express the non-Euclidean characteristics of the brain signal.

The GNN-based models were then trained on each of the obtained class-specific graphs to have specificity for the corresponding class. Finally, the stacking ensemble learning with a gating network was introduced to weight the models for the final prediction. The proposed method was evaluated on a public dataset consisting of three types of overt movements.

Considering these inconsistencies, we introduce a machine learning approach aimed at distinguishing between individuals that respond and do not respond to tPBM treatment based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) acquired before the treatment. We measured nine cognitive scores and recorded fNIRS data from 62 older adults with cognitive decline (43 experimental and 19 control subjects). The experimental group underwent tPBM intervention over a span of 12 weeks. Based on the comparison of the global cognitive score (GCS), merging the nine cognitive scores into a single representation, acquired before and after tPBM treatment, we classified all participants as responders or non-responders to tPBM with a threshold for the GCS change. The fNIRS data were recorded during the resting state, recognition memory task (RMT), Stroop task, and verbal fluency task. A regularized support vector machine was utilized to classify the responders and non-responders to tPBM. The most promising performance of our machine learning model was observed when using the fNIRS data collected during the RMT, which yielded an accuracy of 0.8537, an F1-score of 0.8421, sensitivity of 0.7619, and specificity of 0.95.

Among various types of modulation in signal transmission, morse code stands out due to its simplicity and efficiency in information transmission while costing small bandwidth. In practice, however, it is extremely laborious to locate morse signals in wideband communication. It's a needle in a haystack, if morse code is sent in random carrier waves at random period. To avoid this, automatic morse signal detection has become a challenging task in wireless morse communications, and new solutions could be derived from the latest machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework, namely DeepMorse, to blindly detect morse signals in wideband spectrum data. In particular, we first develop a multi-signal sensing module to retrieve signal candidates from wideband spectrum without prior knowledge. Then, we construct a CNN-based module to extract informative features from the located candidates, in order to distinguish the morse signal from other types of modulation. To evaluate the proposed DeepMorse model, we set up a testbed utilizing commercialized long-distance wireless communication devices.

Physiological and experimental factors influence the accuracy of non-invasive glucose monitoring, and these need to be overcome before replacing the finger prick method. Also, the suitable employment of machine learning techniques can significantly improve the accuracy of glucose predictions. One aim of this study is to use light sources with multiple wavelengths to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of glucose detection in an aqueous solution. Multiple wavelength measurements have the potential to compensate for errors associated with inter- and intra-individual differences in blood and tissue components. In this study, the transmission measurements of a custom built optical sensor are examined using 18 different wavelengths between 410 and 940 nm. Results show a high correlation value (0.98) between glucose concentration and transmission intensity for four wavelengths (485, 645, 860 and 940 nm). Five machine learning methods are investigated for glucose predictions. When regression methods are used, 9% of glucose predictions fall outside the correct range (normal, hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic). The prediction accuracy is improved by applying classification methods on sets of data arranged into 21 classes. Data within each class corresponds to a discrete 10 mg/dL glucose range. Classification based models outperform regression, and among them, the support vector machine is the most successful with F1-score of 99%. Additionally, Clarke error grid shows that 99.75% of glucose readings fall within the clinically acceptable zones.

This is why it is crucial to employ proximal monitoring techniques to detect early signs of nutrient stress and prevent yield loss. In this study, we continuously monitored the stem impedance of eight tomato plants every hour for 38 days. This was done to observe the effects of iron stress by comparing these plants with those not under stress. The normalized impedance magnitude at 10 kHz reveals a noticeable divergence in the trend of impedance magnitude shortly after the removal of iron from the nutrient solution, clearly indicating the effect of iron stress on plant bioimpedance. Additionally, the Cole equivalent circuit model was employed to evaluate the electrical parameters of the impedance spectra. The fitting results exhibit an average root-mean-square error of 466.3 $\Omega$. Statistical analysis of the extracted circuit parameters shows significant differences between iron-stressed and control plants. Based on this hypothesis, the extracted circuit components have been used to train the machine learning classification model with several algorithms, to demonstrate that the multilayer perceptron is the best performing model, yielding 98% accuracy and 91% and 89% precision in identifying early and late stress, respectively. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of bioimpedance measurements in tracking iron stress in plants.

Seismic convolution method is an efficient way to synthesize seismic data, which can easily and quickly generate a large amount of training datasets. However, there are large differences in feature space between synthetic seismic data and real seismic data. That results in the poor performance of network models trained using synthetic training datasets on real seismic data. In this article, we propose to use Fourier domain adaptation (FDA) to achieve domain transfer. First, the amplitude spectrum of synthetic seismic data is replaced with those of real seismic data to make feature space mapping. Then synthetic seismic data is used for transfer training of network models to improve their performance on real seismic data. The experimental results demonstrate that the FDA performs the domain transfer of synthetic seismic data to real seismic data, which improves the generalization of network models trained based on synthetic seismic data.

In this study, we propose a method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of caffeine in various medicines using terahertz spectroscopy combined with chemometrics. By comparing this terahertz (THz) spectroscopy technology (Fourier transform infrared instrument, FTIR) with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Raman spectroscopy, we prove that there is less than a 5% difference between the THz and HPLC results, which is far superior to the nondestructive testing results obtained using Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the quantitative analysis of caffeine in 86 medicines was conducted using the support vector regression (SVR) chemometric method, and the correlation coefficient R achieves 99.61%. Therefore, we have effectively proven that THz spectroscopy technology combined with chemometric can achieve nondestructive, fast, and efficient qualitative and quantitative detection of key ingredients in medicines.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116980","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61922059,81961138014,61771314); Key Domestic scientific And Technological Cooperation Projects in Shanghai(grant numbers:21015800200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9570168","Caffeine;chemometric;medicine;FTIR;HPLC;Raman;terahertz","Spectroscopy;Medical diagnostic imaging;Compounds;Temperature measurement;Statistical analysis;Absorption;Liquids","","8","","59","CCBYNCND","13 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose of this paper is to present the conceptual framework of end-to-end learning for spectrum monitoring and systematically introduce a generic methodology to easily design and implement wireless signal classifiers. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of the choice of wireless data representation to various spectrum monitoring tasks. In particular, two case studies are elaborated: 1) modulation recognition and 2) wireless technology interference detection. For each case study three convolutional neural networks are evaluated for the following wireless signal representations: temporal IQ data, the amplitude/phase representation, and the frequency domain representation. From our analysis, we prove that the wireless data representation impacts the accuracy depending on the specifics and similarities of the wireless signals that need to be differentiated, with different data representations resulting in accuracy variations of up to 29%. Experimental results show that using the amplitude/phase representation for recognizing modulation formats can lead to performance improvements up to 2% and 12% for medium to high SNR compared to IQ and frequency domain data, respectively.

Previously this diagnosis has been done using plant image data taken with a smartphone. However for this method disease symptoms need to be visible. Unfortunately for some cassava diseases, once symptoms have manifested on the aerial part of the plant, the root which is the edible part of the plant has been totally destroyed. This research is premised on the hypothesis that diseased crops without visible symptoms can be detected using spectral information, allowing for early interventions. In this paper, we analyze visible and near-infrared spectra captured from leaves infected with two common cassava diseases (cassava brown streak disease and cassava mosaic virus disease) found in Sub-Saharan Africa. We also take spectra from leaves of healthy plants. The spectral data come with thousands of dimensions, therefore different wavelengths are analyzed in order to identify the most relevant spectral bands for diagnosing these disease. To cope with the nominally high number of input dimensions of data, functional decomposition of the spectra is applied. The classification task is addressed using Generalized Matrix Relevance Learning Vector Quantization and compared with the standard classification techniques performed in the space of expansion coefficients.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3087231","Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(grant numbers:OPP1112548); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448029","Cassava disease diagnosis;feature selection;matrix relevance learning;spectral data","Diseases;Feature extraction;Prototypes;Task analysis;Agriculture;Spectroscopy;Training","","19","","36","CCBY","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It can only produce low spatial resolution images in most cases and thus hyperspectral image (HSI) spatial super-resolution is important. Recently, deep learning-based methods for HSI spatial super-resolution have been actively exploited. However, existing methods do not focus on structural spatial-spectral correlation and global correlation along spectra, which cannot fully exploit useful information for super-resolution. Also, some of the methods are straightforward extension of RGB super-resolution methods, which have fixed number of spectral channels and cannot be generally applied to hyperspectral images whose number of channels varies. Furthermore, unlike RGB images, existing HSI datasets are small and limit the performance of learning-based methods. In this article, we design a bidirectional 3D quasi-recurrent neural network for HSI super-resolution with arbitrary number of bands. Specifically, we introduce a core unit that contains a 3D convolutional module and a bidirectional quasi-recurrent pooling module to effectively extract structural spatial-spectral correlation and global correlation along spectra, respectively. By combining domain knowledge of HSI with a novel pretraining strategy, our method can be well generalized to remote sensing HSI datasets with limited number of training data. Extensive evaluations and comparisons on HSI super-resolution demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both restoration accuracy and visual quality.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3057936","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61827901,62088101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9351612","Bidirectional 3D quasi-recurrent neural network;global correlation along spectra;hyperspectral image super-resolution;structural spatial-spectral correlation","Superresolution;Three-dimensional displays;Correlation;Spatial resolution;Deep learning;Training;Convolution","","63","","51","CCBYNCND","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The heavy metal element lead (Pb) was selected as a preferred detection target. The near infrared photoacoustic spectra of contaminated soil samples with various concentrations of Pb were collected and the spectroscopic relationship between the soil absorption peaks and Pb concentrations was analyzed. Four advanced spectral preprocessing methods were explored to improve the robustness of the prediction model. Based on the maximal correlation coefficient and minimal root mean square error criteria of prediction, a two-layer feed-forward network with a continuum removing preprocessing method with a correlation coefficient as 0.96 was tested as the most appropriate method for Pb concentration prediction.

The ability to quickly and accurately detect the composition and concentration of gases has become a hot topic in current research. In response to address issues such as difficulties in judging data for classification and recognizing gas components with low accuracy, a KNN-SVM algorithm has been proposed. The algorithm primarily reclassifies ambiguous data that are close to the hyperplane but do not have a clear affiliation, capturing data characteristics more comprehensively. It determines the weight ratio of each algorithm through experiments to improve the accuracy of gas category discrimination. Experimental results show that, compared to the traditional SVM algorithm, the KNN-SVM algorithm performs better in gas classification prediction, with an accuracy rate of 99.167% and an AUC indicator of 99.375%, enhancing the accuracy of gas detection. In response to the impact of temperature on the system during the experimental process, a WOA-BP temperature compensation model was established to compensate for temperature in gas concentration detection. After comparing various optimized BP neural network models, the performance of the WOA-BP temperature compensation was the most outstanding, with an R2 of 97.89%, MAE of 1.4868, RMSE of 2.0416, and a convergence speed after 15 iterations, reducing detection errors and thus achieving precise detection of low-concentration mixed gases.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2024.3379197","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFD1100104); Teaching and Research Project of Hubei Provincial Department of Education(grant numbers:2022277); Industry-University-Research Project of Wuhan Municipal Education Bureau(grant numbers:CXY202210); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10493139","Photoacoustic spectroscopy;gas detection;KNN-SVM;temperature compensation;WOA-BP","Classification algorithms;Support vector machines;Gases;Prediction algorithms;Vectors;Signal processing algorithms;Predictive models","","1","","23","CCBY","5 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is often invalid for unknown samples beyond the scope of modeling samples, as well as it is not efficient in conditions of insufficient samples (insufficient number of samples within the class), unbalanced samples (large difference in the number of samples between classes), and sensitivity of identification results (different tolerance for different errors in application scenarios). To solve these problems, this paper proposes a general method for on-site identification of counterfeit drugs based on Siamese-network modeling with near-infrared spectroscopy, which especially constructs the train set and test set, learning the general knowledge of spectral differences to identify the different drugs by a costumed one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN), and finally answered the question of whether the on-site two spectra are pointed to the same drug. Based on experimental modeling samples of 1314 spectra, which are involved 9 drugs produced by 25 manufacturers, this paper has constructed and fully trained its model. Then, not known at the time of modeling, 4 drugs produced by 9 manufacturers are used for testing in the on-site application, and the accuracy rate amounts to 97.3%. For generalizing consideration, randomly divided into training and testing categories, the 32015 spectra of 135 drugs produced by 391 manufacturers in the spectral library are handled by the same processing. The generalization model is equally applicable, and the accuracy is above 97%.

To address these challenges, we present Tinto, a multisensor benchmark digital outcrop dataset designed to facilitate the development and validation of deep learning approaches for geological mapping, especially for nonstructured 3-D data like point clouds. Tinto comprises two complementary sets: 1) a real digital outcrop model from Corta Atalaya (Spain), with spectral attributes and ground-truth data and 2) a synthetic twin that uses latent features in the original datasets to reconstruct realistic spectral data (including sensor noise and processing artifacts) from the ground truth. The point cloud is dense and contains 3242964 labeled points. We used these datasets to explore the abilities of different deep learning approaches for automated geological mapping. By making Tinto publicly available, we hope to foster the development and adaptation of new deep learning tools for 3-D applications in Earth sciences.

In this letter, we present a method to predict the stochastic PBL height (SPBLH) using ceilometer data and a deep learning approach based on a fully connected neural network (NN). We found a correlation between the Lyapunov coefficient calculated for each SPBLH time series and the loss function, which is influenced by various factors such as atmospheric parameters, pollution, aerosols, and more. The performance of a typical NN used to predict a time series is significantly affected by the degree of chaos, quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponents (LLEs). Our results show a decrease in accuracy as a function of increasing LLE.

On a number of occasions, these states are linked to point process bioelectric and biochemical observations coupled together with continuous-valued variables. These observations provide a means to estimate the latent states of interest. We develop a state-space method to estimate unobserved sympathetic arousal and energy production states from skin conductance and cortisol data respectively, comprising of a marked point process and a continuous-valued observation. The method involves Bayesian filtering applied within an expectation-maximization (EM) framework for state estimation and model parameter recovery. Results are evaluated on both simulated and experimental data. On experimental skin conductance data, high arousal levels are generally detected during cognitive stress periods and lower values are detected during relaxation. Results are also in conformity with general physiology for cortisol data. On separate experimental data, skin conductance-based estimates are validated/cross-checked with functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy features. Estimation is also performed on heart rate and skin conductance data to illustrate the method’s wider applicability. We also compare the method with earlier approaches. We show how it outperforms a previous method for cortisol-based energy estimation, and its superiority to earlier methods for estimating sympathetic arousal. The EM approach is thus able to estimate latent physiological states within the body from point process bioelectric and biochemical phenomena. The method could be applied in wearable monitoring and automated closed-loop therapy delivery for patients diagnosed with certain types of neuropsychiatric or hormone disorders.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3334974","NSF CAREER: MINDWATCH: Multimodal Intelligent Noninvasive brain state Decoder for Wearable AdapTive Closed-loop arcHitectures(grant numbers:2226123); NSF Computer and Information Science and Engineering Research Initiation Initiative (CRII): Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS): Wearable-Machine Interface Architectures(grant numbers:1755780); New York University (NYU) start-up funds; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10323308","Biomedical signal processing;state-space methods;estimation;emotion recognition;Kalman filters","Emotion recognition;Physiology;Blood;Estimation;Computer aided software engineering;Bayes methods;Biomedical signal processing;State-space methods;Kalman filters","","5","","93","CCBY","20 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These blooms can be detected using optical radiometers due to the presence of phycocyanin (PC) pigments. The spectral resolution of best-available multispectral sensors limits their ability to diagnostically detect PC in the presence of other photosynthetic pigments. To assess the role of spectral resolution in the determination of PC, a large ( $N =905$ ) database of colocated in situ radiometric spectra and PC are employed. We first examine the performance of selected widely used machine-learning (ML) models against that of benchmark algorithms for hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance ( $R_{\mathrm {rs}}$ ) spectra resampled to the spectral configuration of the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of < 6 nm. Results show that the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network applied to HICO spectral configurations (median errors < 65%) outperforms other ML models. This model is subsequently applied to  $R_{\mathrm {rs}}$  spectra resampled to the band configuration of existing satellite instruments and of the one proposed for the next Landsat sensor. These results confirm that employing MLP models to estimate PC from hyperspectral data delivers tangible improvements compared with retrievals from multispectral data and benchmark algorithms (with median errors between  $\sim 73$ % and 126%) and shows promise for developing a globally applicable cyanobacteria measurement approach.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3114635","Global Water Futures Program (Transformative Sensor Technologies and Smart Watersheds Project); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES)(grant numbers:80NSSC20M0235,80NSSC21K0499); United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat Science Team(grant numbers:140G0118C0011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9570275","Cyanobacteria harmful algal bloom (Cyano HAB);hyperspectral;machine learning (ML);neural network;phycocyanin (PC);spectral resolution","Hyperspectral imaging;Optical sensors;Pigments;Monitoring;Lakes;Absorption;Sea measurements","","17","","126","CCBY","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The general pattern recognition method for fluorescence spectral classification is highly dependent on pretreatment and dimension reduction. Specific pretreatment and dimension reduction methods are required for specific substances. Deep learning, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN), has the advantage of low dependence on data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction process, which makes it perform well in spectral classification. However, learning a useful CNN model for classification depends crucially on the expertise of parameter tuning and some ad hoc tricks, which is not suitable for chemometrics researchers. This paper presents a novel chemometrics tool for fluorescence spectra, principal component analysis network (PCANet), and more specifically a PCANet model with the optimized hyper-parameters (only optimized once). A two-stage cascaded PCANet model is constructed based on the liquor dataset, and the hyper-parameters are optimized and determined, which can make PCANet recognition model with the highest accuracy. Comparing the CNN model with two convolutional layers, the PCANet model is less affected by the size of the input image and the number of samples in the training set. At the same time, the performance of the two models on the mine water dataset is analyzed, and PCANet has higher recognition accuracy. That is to say, the PCANet is more accurate than CNN in fluorescence spectral classification, and its ability to expand application is stronger than that of the CNN model. The successful application of PCANet model with the optimized hyper-parameters (only optimized once) in the liquor dataset and the mine water dataset has important reference significance for the classification of fluorescence spectra of other substances in the future.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933453","National Safe Production Critical Incident to Key Technologies Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:anhui-0001-2016AQ,anhui-0010-2018AQ); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:1808085QE157); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789412","Laser-induced fluorescence;spectral classification;principal component analysis network;hyper-parameter","Fluorescence;Deep learning;Dimensionality reduction;Analytical models;Neurons;Support vector machines;Principal component analysis","","9","","54","CCBY","6 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, a vision-based ripe FFB detection system is proposed as the first step in a robotic FFB harvesting system. In this work, live camera input is fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model known as YOLOv4 to detect the presence of ripe FFBs on the oil palm trees in real-time. Once a ripe FFB is detected on the tree, a signal is transmitted via ROS to the robotic harvesting mechanism. To train the YOLOv4 model, a large number of ripe FFB images were collected using an Intel Realsense Camera D435 with a resolution of  $1920\times 1080$ . During data acquisition, a subject matter expert assisted in classifying the FFBs in terms of ripe or unripe.

Because the cognitive mechanisms such as human sensation and perception from cognitive science are fast responses ranging from a few milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds, the method of pattern recognition and analysis of these brain signals must be done and it is necessary to derive some information. In this paper, we investigated time-series data of cognitive function of the brain obtained using a non-invasive technique on multiple channels via signal classification and analysis, using a cognitive science approach and experiments. The test dataset was collected in 19 channels using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) techniques with multiple rests and working conditions on eight subjects. From this perspective, the main contributions of this paper are that it completes the collection and analysis of cognitive-scientific time-series data and has scientific implications that extend to other integrated domains, energy, manufacturing, bioinformatics, and finance area. The use of Shapelet and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) classification techniques on brain signal time-series shows the potential to identify neuro-biological phenomena that can proactively signal a disease or disorder.

Multivariate analysis methods have been widely applied in hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy for classification.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been employed in image recognition, could effectively learn interpretable presentations of the sample without the need of ad-hoc preprocessing steps. The species of silkworm pupae are usually up to hundreds. Conventional classifiers based on one species of silkworm pupae could not give high performance when explored to other species that not participating in the model building, resulting in bad generalization ability. In this study, a CNN model was trained to automatically identify the sex of silkworm pupae from different years and species based on the hyperspectral spectra. The results were compared with the frequently used conventional machine classifiers including support vector machine (SVM) and K nearest neighbors (KNN). The results showed that CNN outperformed SVM and KNN in terms of accuracy when applied to the raw spectra with 98.03%. However, the performance of CNN decreased to 95.09% when combined with the preprocessed data. Then principal component analysis (PCA) was adopted to reduce data dimensionality and extract features. CNN gave higher accuracy than SVM and KNN based on PCA.

The accurate determination of coal concentration is of great significance for the purification and secondary utilization of mine water. To study the spectral inversion method of coal concentration in mine water, samples with different coal concentrations of 0mg/L-1000mg/L are prepared in this paper, and the ASD Field Spec 4 (350-2500nm) spectrometer is used for spectral collection. It is found that the maximum influence of different coal content on spectral reflectance is 0.9. Based on this, the CK-CNN (C-K-Convolutional Neural Networks) inversion model of coal content in mine water is proposed. This model uses the CARS (Competitive Adapative Reweighted Sampling) algorithm to extract sensitive wave bands and uses CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to establish spectral inversion model in sensitive wave bands, K-fold cross-validation is used to optimize the model, the model inversion accuracy is R2 = 0.9994, RMSE=6.1401, RPD=41.9692. In this study, CK-CNN was compared with five models: SPA+RF, CARS+RF, SPA+CNN, All Band +CNN, and CARS+CNN. The results show that the CK-CNN model has the best effect. In addition, the concentration of water coal in Jiaozuo Zhongma Coal Mine is 18.75mg/L, the actual concentration measured in the laboratory is 18.92mg/L, and the inversion error is 0.17mg/L. The inversion results meet the requirements of laboratory measurement in GB11901-1989. The research results show that the hyperspectral remote sensing in the visible-near-infrared band can quickly detect the coal concentration in the mine water.

Effectively estimating the health state of LIBs online is the key but is also the most difficult task for energy storage systems. With high adaptability and applicability advantages, battery health state estimation based on data-driven techniques has attracted extensive attention from researchers around the world. Artificial neural network (ANN)-based methods are often used for state estimations of LIBs. As one of the ANN methods, the Elman neural network (ENN) model has been improved to estimate the battery state more efficiently and accurately. In this paper, an improved ENN estimation method based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cuckoo search (CS) is established as the EIS-CS-ENN model to estimate the health state of LIBs. Also, the paper conducts a critical review of various ANN models against the EIS-CS-ENN model. This demonstrates that the EIS-CS-ENN model outperforms other models. The review also proves that, under the same conditions, selecting appropriate health indicators (HIs) according to the mathematical modeling ability and state requirements are the keys in estimating the health state efficiently. In the calculation process, several evaluation indicators are adopted to analyze and compare the modeling accuracy with other existing methods.

The SUs in the CR network senses the spectrum band to opportunistically access the white space. Exploiting the white spaces helps to improve the spectrum efficiency. Owing to the excellent learning ability of machine learning/deep learning framework, many works in the recent past have applied shallow/deep multi-layer perceptron approach for spectrum sensing. However, the multi-layer perceptron networks are not well suited for time-series data due to the absence of memory elements. On the other hand, long short-term memory (LSTM) network, an improved version of Recurrent neural network is well suited for time-series data. In this paper, we propose an LSTM based spectrum sensing (LSTM-SS), which learns the implicit features from the spectrum data, for instance, the temporal correlation (i.e., the correlation between the present and past timestamp).Moreover, the CR systems also exploits the PU activity statistics to improve the CR performance. In this context, we compute the PU activity statistics like on and off period duration, duty cycle and propose the PU activity statistics based spectrum sensing (PAS-SS) to enhance the sensing performance. The proposed sensing schemes are validated on the spectrum data of various radio technologies acquired using an experimental test-bed setup. The proposed LSTM-SS scheme is compared with the state of the art spectrum sensing techniques. Experimental results indicate that the proposed schemes has improved detection performance and classification accuracy at low signal to noise ratio regimes.

"K-Means Clustering Machine Learning Approach Reveals Groups of Homogeneous Individuals With Unique Brain Activation, Task, and Performance Dynamics Using fNIRS","M. J.

However, human’s brain hemodynamic response, behavior, and cognitive and task performance vary, even within and across homogeneous individuals (with same training and skill sets), which limits the reliability of any predictive model for human. In the context of high-stakes tasks, such as in military and first-responder operations, the real-time monitoring of cognitive functions and relating it to the ongoing task, performance outcomes, and behavioral dynamics of the personnel and teams is invaluable. In this work, a portable wearable fNIRS system (WearLight) developed by the author was upgraded, and an experimental protocol was designed to image the prefrontal cortex (PFC) area of the brain of 25 healthy homogeneous participants in a naturalistic environment while participants performed n-back working memory (WM) tasks with four difficulty levels. The raw fNIRS signals were processed using a signal processing pipeline to derive the brain’s hemodynamic responses. An unsupervised k-means machine learning (ML) clustering approach, utilizing the task-induced hemodynamic responses as input variables, suggested three unique participant groups. Task performance in terms of % correct, % missing, reaction time, inverse efficiency score (IES), and a proposed IES was extensively evaluated for each participant and the three groups. Results showed that, on average, brain hemodynamic response increased, whereas task performance degraded, with increasing WM load. However, the regression and correlation analysis of WM task, performance, and the brain’s hemodynamic responses (TPH) revealed interesting hidden characteristics and the variation in the TPH relationship between groups. The proposed IES also served as a better scoring method that had distinct score ranges for different load levels as opposed to the overlapping scores of the traditional IES method.

In order to detect subtle bruises on winter jujubes in a more efficient way, a rapid and accurate technique, hyperspectral imaging was used. Near-infrared reflectance (NIR) and visible/near-infrared reflectance (Vis-NIR) hyperspectral imaging at the spectral region of 874-1734 nm and 380-1030 nm, respectively, were applied in this study. The hyperspectral images of winter jujubes from four geographical origins were acquired. Pixel-wise spectra were extracted and preprocessed; pixel-wise principal component analysis (PCA) was used to conduct a qualitative analysis. Accuracy, true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) were utilized to compare the efficiency of the models. Support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR) and a deep learning method, and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to build pixel-wise classification models based on single or all geographical origins for quantitative analyses. All the models using NIR spectra obtained decent results with accuracies in the range of 90–100%, and TPRs and FPRs close to 1 and 0, respectively. Compared with the other two methods using Vis-NIR spectra, the CNN model based on all geographical origins got the best performance with most of the accuracies surpassing 85%. For Vis-NIR spectra and NIR spectra, the overall time efficiency for modeling and prediction of CNN was at an intermediate level among the three models. The short prediction time of CNN indicated that CNN had the potential for real-time detection. The prediction maps obtained by the CNN models indicated that the color information and geographical origins could affect the detection performance.

To overcome this limitation, this article proposes novel supervised and unsupervised physics-informed deep learning (DL) methods for amplitude and phase recovery by incorporating angular spectrum diffraction theory as prior knowledge. First, we demonstrate that our unsupervised dual network can predict both amplitude and phase simultaneously, overcoming the limitations of previous studies that could only predict phase objects. This is demonstrated using synthetic 2-D image data as well as measured diffraction images. The advantage of unsupervised DL is its ability to be used directly without labeling by human experts. In addition, we address supervised DL, which is a concept of general applicability. We introduce training with a database set of 2-D images taken in the visible spectra range and numerically modified by us to emulate THz images. This approach allows us to avoid the prohibitively time-consuming collection of a large number of THz-frequency images. Furthermore, we employ a combination method that enhances the sharpness of image edges, improves contrast, and effectively aligns the approach with the ground truth. The results obtained using both approaches represent the initial steps toward fast holographic THz imaging with reference-beam-free, low-cost power detection.","2156-3446","","10.1109/TTHZ.2024.3349482","XF-IJRC; German Research Foundation DFG(grant numbers:RO 770/48-1); BMBF; Samson; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10379686","Amplitude estimation;deep learning;phase esitmation;signal reconstruction;terahertz wave imaging","Diffraction;Image reconstruction;Imaging;Training;Convolutional neural networks;Phase measurement;Recording;Amplitude estimation;Deep learning;Terahertz wave imaging","","3","","46","CCBY","3 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, this study proposes a novel joint-channel-connectivity-based feature selection and classification algorithm for fNIRS to detect stress in decision-making. Specifically, this approach integrates feature selection and classifier modeling into a sparse model, where intra- and inter-channel regularizers are designed to explore potential correlations among channels to obtain discriminating features.

Experimental results illustrated that our method with the accuracy of 0.961 is superior to other machine learning methods. Additionally, the stress correlation and connectivity of brain regions calculated by feature selection have been confirmed in previous studies, which validates the effectiveness of our method and helps optimize the channel settings of fNIRS.

This paper presents the design and development of a fully automated robot for the preparation of fungal samples for FTIR spectroscopy. The whole system was constructed based on a previously-developed ultrasonication robot module, by adding a newly-designed centrifuge module and a newly-developed liquid handling module. The liquid handling module consists of a high accuracy electric pipette for spotting and a low accuracy syringe pump for sample washing and concentration. A dual robotic arm system with a gripper connects all of the hardware components. Furthermore, a camera on the liquid handling module uses deep learning to identify the labware settings, which includes the number and positions of well plates and pipette tips. Machine vision on the ultrasonication robot module can detect the sample wells and return the locations to the liquid handling module, which makes the system hand-free for users. Tight integration of all the modules enables the robot to process up to two 96-well microtiter (MTP) plates of samples simultaneously. Performance evaluation shows the deep learning based approach can detect four classes of labware with high average precision, from 0.93 to 1.0. In addition, tests of all procedures show that the robot is able to provide homogeneous sample spots for FTIR spectroscopy with high positional accuracy and spot coverage rate.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941704","Norges Miljø- og Biovitenskapelige Universitet; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839095","Laboratory automation;robotics;deep learning;ultrasonication;spotting;FTIR spectroscopy","Spectroscopy;Liquids;Deep learning;Manipulators;Machine vision;Microorganisms","","13","","22","CCBY","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, how to effectively evaluate the neonatal blood circulation state is important for the treatment in time. Although some instruments, such as laser Doppler flow meter, can estimate the information of blood flow, there is still lack of monitoring systems to evaluate the neonatal blood circulation directly. Based on the technique of near-infrared spectroscopy, an intelligent neonatal blood perfusion assessment system was proposed in this study, to monitor the changes of hemoglobin concentration and tissue oxygen saturation simultaneously and further estimate the neonatal blood perfusion. Several indexes were defined from the changes of hemoglobin parameters under applying and relaxing pressure to obtain the neonatal perfusion information. Moreover, the neural network-based classifier was also used to effectively classify the groups with different blood perfusion states. From the experimental results, the difference between the groups with different blood perfusion states could exactly be reflected on several defined indexes and could be effectively recognized by using the technique of neural network.

Although a curative therapy has yet to be found, permanent monitoring of biomarkers that reflect the disease progression plays a pivotal role for the effective management of COPD. The accurate examination of respiratory tract fluids like saliva is a promising approach for staging disease and predicting its upcoming exacerbations in a Point-of-Care (PoC) environment. However, the concurrent consideration of patients’ demographic and medical parameters is necessary for achieving accurate outcomes. Therefore, Machine Learning (ML) tools can play an important role for analyzing patient data and providing comprehensive results for the recognition of COPD in a PoC setting. As a result, the objective of this research work was to implement ML tools on data acquired from characterizing saliva samples of COPD patients and healthy controls as well as their demographic information for PoC recognition of the disease. For this purpose, a permittivity biosensor was used to characterize dielectric properties of saliva samples and, subsequently, ML tools were applied on the acquired data for classification. The XGBoost gradient boosting algorithm provided a high classification accuracy and sensitivity of 91.25% and 100%, respectively, making it a promising model for COPD evaluation. Integration of this model on a neuromorphic chip, in the future, will enable the real-time assessment of COPD in PoC, with low cost, low energy consumption, and high patient privacy. In addition, constant monitoring of COPD in a near-patient setup will enable the better management of the disease exacerbations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3023971","Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) of Germany for the EXASENS(grant numbers:13U13862); Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195859","COPD classification;AI in medicine;personalized healthcare;permittivity spectroscopy;precision diagnostic;saliva characterization;medical machine learning;XGBoost","Diseases;Dielectrics;Lung;Tools;Biosensors;Permittivity;Machine learning","","26","","35","CCBY","14 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in the wood domain, spatial information is also relevant. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a CNN-based end-to-end framework for the classification of hyperspectral images in the wood domain.

In this study, we introduce a novel feature selection method, termed Optimal Subspace Wavelength Reduction (OSWR), and integrate it with reflectance Visible-Near Infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy to enhance the discrimination between pure and adulterated honey and predict adulteration levels. OSWR efficiently addresses the dimensionality challenge of large spectral datasets, reducing 2151 wavelengths to a compact and informative set of 39 wavelengths. We comprehensively evaluate machine learning (ML) models, focusing on OSWR as a pivotal component of our methodology. Our results reveal remarkable success in discriminating among pure honey, adulterated honey, and sugar syrup, with an impressive classification accuracy of 96.67% achieved using OSWR, coupled with Standard Normal Variate (SNV) preprocessing, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) feature extraction, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification.

The purpose of this study is to establish a driver intention prediction model. Design/methodology/approach - The authors used the NIRx device to measure the cerebral cortex activities for identifying the driver's braking intention. The experiment was carried out in a virtual reality environment. During the experiment, the driving simulator recorded the driving data and the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device recorded the changes in hemoglobin concentration in the cerebral cortex.

As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) has great advantages in training heterogeneous data and data island. In order to solve the data island and data heterogeneity of HDP, we propose a novel Federated Reinforcement Learning via Gradient Clustering (FRLGC) method in this paper. Firstly, the parameters of the global model are transferred to each dueling deep Q network (dueling DQN) model and each client uses private data to train the dueling model which combines experience replay to increase data efficiency in limited datasets. Secondly, gaussian differential privacy is used to encrypt the model parameters to ensure the privacy and security of the model. Finally, we cluster the clients according to their locally encrypted model parameters and use weighted average to aggregate to create a new global model locally and globally.

The origin of these patterns can be traced to either instrumental or natural ground effects. Identifying these signals’ origin and nature helps to enhance automatic P-wave identification and earthquake source parameter determination. Several investigations have been accomplished to define the origin of these precursory signals, starting from installing a temporary station with 50 and 200 sampling rates for 17 months, in addition to the original station with a sampling rate of 100 samples per second at the New Abu Dabbab station (NADB). From these two stations, 429 earthquakes were recorded at three sampling rates: 50, 100, and 200 samples per second. Then, a spectral analysis was performed, where it was found that there was a clear relationship between the first pattern and the acquisition sampling rate. This proved that the first pattern (the ramping pattern) is an instrumental artifact that occurs from the finite impulse response (FIR) filter in the analog-to-digital conversion stage of the digitizer. The other type of precursory signals was found to have varying spectra independent of the used sampling rate. This led to the differentiation of the natural ground origin and instrumental artifacts-based signals in front of these earthquakes. By automating the classification of these patterns, the true P-wave arrival can be determined in real-time processing, reducing the error in P-wave arrival timing. The current study also introduces this automatic classification by developing various machine learning (ML) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to highlight the features characterizing each pattern. The classifier topology distinguishes these patterns, and then the automatic P-wave detector can decide the arrival of the P-wave depending on the type of precursory. In instrumental artifacts, the arrival is taken after the precursory and before it in the case of the natural ground-based pattern. The examined classification topologies are Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest neighbors Classifier (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier (DT), Random Forest Classifier (RF), XGB Classifier, Naïve Bayes (NB), Voting Classifier and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Out of these methodologies, the CNN outperformed with a classification accuracy of 97.67% because of its capability in feature extraction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3550167","Researchers Supporting Project, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,(grant numbers:RSP2025R249); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10921643","Precursory segments;seismic nucleation phase;nano seismology;FIR effect;machine learning (ML);deep learning;convolutional neural network (CNN)","Earthquakes;Instruments;Convolutional neural networks;Finite impulse response filters;Time series analysis;Support vector machines;Random forests;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Topology","","","","59","CCBY","11 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our proposal relies on a patch-based multibranch convolutional neural network (CNN) that exploits different per-source encoders to deal with the specificity of the input signals. In addition, we introduce a new self-distillation strategy to boost the per-source analyses and exploit the interplay among the different input sources. This new strategy leverages the final prediction of the multisource framework to guide the learning of the per-source CNN encoders supporting the network to learn from itself.

However, real-time processing of fNIRS/DOT data remains a significant challenge as it requires establishing a baseline of the measurement, simultaneously performing real-time motion artifact (MA) correction across all channels, and (in the case of DOT) addressing the time-consuming process of image reconstruction. This study proposes a real-time processing system for fNIRS/DOT that integrates baseline calibration, denoising autoencoder (DAE) based MA correction model with a sliding window strategy, and a pre-calculated inverse Jacobian matrix to streamline the reconstructed 3D brain hemodynamics. The DAE model was trained on an extensive whole-head high-density DOT (HD-DOT) dataset and tested on separate motor imagery dataset augmented with artificial MA. The system demonstrated the capability to simultaneously process approximately 750 channels in real-time. Our results show that the DAE-based MA correction method outperformed traditional MA correction in terms of mean squared error and correlation to the known MA-free data while maintaining low latency, which is critical for effective BCI and NFB applications. The system’s high-channel, real-time processing capability provides channel-wise oxygenation information and functional 3D imaging, making it well-suited for fNIRS/DOT applications in BCI and NFB, particularly in movement-intensive scenarios such as motor rehabilitation and assistive technology for mobility support.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2025.3553794","Royal Society Research(grant numbers:RGS\R2\222333); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:13171178 R00287); European Innovation Council (EIC) through the European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:101099093); Department of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science; Wellcome Trust and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through the Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) Centre, University College London(grant numbers:203145Z/16/Z); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10937099","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS);diffuse optical tomography (DOT);brain-computer interface (BCI);neurofeedback (NFB);motion artifacts;deep learning;real-time processing","Real-time systems;US Department of Transportation;Hemodynamics;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Optical imaging;Three-dimensional displays;Feedback amplifiers;Jacobian matrices;Image reconstruction;Electroencephalography","Brain-Computer Interfaces;Humans;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared;Neurofeedback;Male;Deep Learning;Algorithms;Tomography, Optical;Artifacts;Female;Adult;Calibration;Young Adult;Computer Systems;Motion","","","50","CCBY","21 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional passive microwave sensors, such as AMSR2, provide reliable SIC estimates but are limited by coarse (5 km) resolution, particularly near coastlines and regions with mixed ice and open water, where finer spatial detail is critical. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery offers a high-resolution alternative. This study applies a U-Net convolutional neural network to Sentinel-1 SAR data, utilizing pixelwise ice-water labels to enhance SIC mapping. To address SAR noise challenges, we incorporate multilooking, adaptive noise correction, and overlapping patches at inference to improve SIC accuracy while preserving fine-scale features. We trained the U-Net across multilooking levels to balance resolution, noise reduction, and computational efficiency, allowing the model to handle noise artefacts effectively. Our results identify an optimal 7 × 7 multilooking level, achieving 280 m ice-water labels and a 2.5 km SIC field when an additional 9 × 9 SIC window is applied. This configuration enhances traditional SIC products by improving the representation of the ice edge, leads, and near-coastal features, which are critical for operational applications. SAR-derived SIC addresses the limitations of passive microwave products by providing superior spatial detail and ice edge resolution. Incorporating additional information from AMSR2 or wind features could strengthen SIC robustness and minimize the misclassification of open water, which is present in the results. These advancements would establish SAR-based SIC as a valuable tool for operational sea ice monitoring and integration into high-resolution models.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3553623","Research Council of Norway through the Sea Ice Retrievals(grant numbers:302917); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10936980","Synthetic aperture radar (SAR);sea ice;U-Net","Sea ice;Noise;Sentinel-1;Synthetic aperture radar;Backscatter;Microwave radiometry;Data models;Training;Meteorology;Earth","","","","54","CCBY","21 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, current classical methods suffer from high false positive rates and therefore prevent easy automation while previously published deep learning models exhibit prohibitive computational requirements. We propose fast and accurate machine learning architectures, which support end-to-end processing of data with high spectral dimension without relying on handcrafted products or spectral band compression techniques. We create three new large datasets of hyperspectral data containing all relevant spectral bands from the near global sensor EMIT. We evaluate our models on two tasks related to hyperspectral data processing—methane detection and mineral identification. Our models reach a new state-of-the-art performance on the task of methane detection, where we improve the F1 score of previous deep learning models by 27% on a newly created synthetic dataset and by 13% on the previously released large benchmark dataset. Our models generalize from synthetic datasets to data with real methane leak events and boost performance by 6.9% in F1 score in contrast with training models from scratch on the real data. Finally, with our newly proposed architectures, one capture from the EMIT sensor can be processed within 30 s on a realistic proxy of the ION-SCV 004 satellite and in less than 0.64 s on a GPU powered Jetson AGX Xavier board.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3557527","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10948267","Efficient machine learning;hyperspectral machine learning;machine learning for imaging spectroscopy;methane detection;mineral identification;on-board deployment","Methane;Hyperspectral imaging;Data models;Minerals;Computer architecture;Adaptation models;Satellites;Computational modeling;Matched filters;Accuracy","","","","74","CCBY","3 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Freeze damage may appear in citrus fruits both in the field and in postharvest processes resulting in quality loss and a difficult commercialization of the fruit. EIS has been used to test a set of homogeneous tangerine samples both fresh and later frozen to analyze electrochemical and biological differences. A double-needle electrode associated to a specifically designed electronic device and software has been designed and used to send an AC electric sinusoidal signal 1 V in amplitude and frequency range [100Hz to 1MHz] to the analyzed samples and then receive the electrochemical impedance response. EIS measurements lead to distinct values of both impedance module and phase of fresh and frozen samples over a wide frequency range. Statistical treatment of the received data set by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) shows a clear classification of the samples depending on the experienced freeze phenomenon, with high sensitivity (1.00), specificity (≥ 0.95) and confidence level (95%). Later Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) analysis based on 20-3-1 architecture has allowed to create a mathematical prediction model able to correctly classify 100% of the analyzed samples (CCR =100% for training, validation and test phases, and overall classification), being fast, easy, robust and reliable, and an interesting alternative method to the traditional laboratory analyses.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3065846","Spanish Government/FEDER funds [Ministerio de Economía y Empresa (MINECO)/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)](grant numbers:RTI2018-100910-B-C43); Conselleria d’Educació, Investigació, Cultura i Esport de la Generalitat Valenciana(grant numbers:GV/2018/090); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377007","Double-needle sensor;electrode;electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS);tangerine;freeze damage;detection;artificial neural networks (ANN)","Sensors;Impedance;Software;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Voltage measurement;Frequency measurement;Electrodes","","10","","72","CCBY","12 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has emerged as a non-invasive, functional imaging modality with great clinical potential. Current research focuses on converting the high-dimensional, not human-interpretable spectral data into the underlying functional information, specifically the blood oxygenation. One of the largely unexplored issues stalling clinical advances is the fact that the quantification problem is ambiguous, i.e. that radically different tissue parameter configurations could lead to almost identical photoacoustic spectra. In the present work, we tackle this problem with conditional Invertible Neural Networks (cINNs). Going beyond traditional point estimates, our network is used to compute an approximation of the conditional posterior density of tissue parameters given the photoacoustic spectrum. To this end, an automatic mode detection algorithm extracts the plausible solution from the sample-based posterior. According to a comprehensive validation study based on both synthetic and real images, our approach is well-suited for exploring ambiguity in quantitative PAT.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2024.3403417","European Research Council (ERC) under European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:101002198); Surgical Oncology Program of the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10538320","Deep learning;inverse problems;invertible networks;photoacoustic imaging;synthetic data;tissue oxygenation","Optical imaging;Biomedical optical imaging;Training;Optical variables measurement;Standards;Couplings;Vectors","Neural Networks, Computer;Photoacoustic Techniques;Algorithms;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Oxygen;Phantoms, Imaging","","","55","CCBY","24 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While rich in spectral information, various complexities, such as environmental conditions, material properties, and sensor characteristics can cause significant variability even among pixels belonging to the same material class. This variability poses nuisance for accurate land-cover classification and analysis. Focusing on the spectral domain, we utilize an autoencoder architecture called the symmetric autoencoder (SymAE), which leverages permutation invariant representation and stochastic regularization in tandem to disentangle class-invariant “coherent” features from variability-causing “nuisance” features on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This disentanglement is achieved through a purely data-driven process, without the need for hand-crafted modeling, noise distribution priors, or reference “clean signals.” In addition, SymAE can generate virtual spectra through manipulations in latent space. Using AVIRIS instrument data, we demonstrate these virtual spectra offer insights on the disentanglement. Extensive experiments across six benchmark hyperspectral datasets show that coherent features extracted by SymAE can be used to achieve state-of-the-art pixel-based classification. Furthermore, we leverage these coherent features to enhance the performance of some leading spectral–spatial hyperspectral image (HSI) classification methods. Our approach especially shows improvement in scenarios where training and test regions are disjoint, a common challenge in real-world applications where existing methods often struggle to maintain relatively high performance.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3533302","Indian Space Research Organization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10852302","Autoencoders;deep learning;hyperspectral image classification;hyperspectral imaging;nuisances;redatuming;spectral feature extraction;variability;virtual images","Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Land surface;Autoencoders;Roads;Accuracy;Vegetation mapping;Training;Deep learning;Crops","","","","72","CCBY","24 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent methods aim to recover the corresponding RGB image directly from the NIR image using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, these methods struggle with accurately recovering both luminance and chrominance information and the inherent deficiencies in NIR image details. In this paper, we propose grayscale-assisted RGB image restoration from NIR images to recover luminance and chrominance information in two stages. We address the complex NIR-to-RGB conversion challenge by decoupling it into two separate stages. First, it converts NIR to grayscale images, focusing on luminance learning. Then, it transforms grayscale to RGB images, concentrating on chrominance information. In addition, we incorporate frequency domain learning to shift the image processing from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, facilitating the restoration of the detailed textures often lost in NIR images. Empirical evaluations of our grayscale-assisted framework and existing state-of-the-art methods demonstrate its superior performance and yield more visually appealing results.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a tool that can potentially supplement clinical interviews and mental state examinations to establish a psychiatric diagnosis and monitor treatment progress. Thirty-two subjects, including 16 patients clinically diagnosed with MDD and 16 healthy controls (HCs), participated in the study. Brain oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) responses were recorded using a 22-channel continuous-wave fNIRS device while the subjects performed the emotional sound test. This study evaluated the difference between MDD patients and HCs using a variety of methods. In a comparison of the Pearson correlation coefficients between the HbO/HbR responses of each fNIRS channel and four scores, MDD patients and HCs had significantly different Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) scores. By quantitative evaluation of the functional association, we found that MDD patients had aberrant functional connectivity compared with HCs. Furthermore, we concluded that compared with HCs, there were marked abnormalities in blood oxygen in the bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Four statistical-based features extracted from HbO signals and four vector-based features from both HbO and HbR served as inputs to four simple neural networks (multilayer neural network (MNN), feedforward neural network (FNN), cascade forward neural network (CFNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)). Through an analysis of combinations of different features, the combination of 4 common features (mean, STD, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and slope) yielded the highest classification accuracy of 89.74% for fear emotion. The combination of four novel feature (CBV, COE,  $\vert {L} \vert $  and K) resulted in a classification accuracy of 99.94% for fear emotion. The top 10 common and novel features were selected by the ReliefF feature selection algorithm, resulting in classification accuracies of 83.52% and 91.99%, respectively. This study identified the AUC and angle K as specific neuromarkers for predicting MDD across specific depression-related regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These findings suggest that the fNIRS measurement of the PFC may serve as a supplementary test in routine clinical practice to further support a diagnosis of MDD.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3115266","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632014,61627808,61210010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9547324","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS);major depressive disorder (MDD);activation patterns;simple neural networks;feature selection","Depression;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Biological neural networks;Indexes;Correlation;Artificial intelligence","Brain;Depression;Depressive Disorder, Major;Humans;Prefrontal Cortex;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared","39","","57","CCBY","23 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm with 176 wavebands (a wavelength interval of 3.41 nm) or 360 wavebands (a wavelength interval of 1.67 nm), labeled as “Datasets_1.67” and “Datasets_3.41”, respectively, were used. Although different spectral data types were used, better prediction results for LCCtot were based on Datasets_1.67 for LCCtot prediction. Several prediction models of LCCtot were built based on partial least squares regression (PLSR), artificial neural networks (ANN), ordinary least squares regression (OLSR), and stepwise linear regression (SLR) using full spectral and effective wavelength (EW) data (raw spectral (RS), first derivative spectral (FDS) and second derivative spectral (SDS) data). The determination coefficient (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE) and the residual predictive deviation (RPD) were used to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the predicted LCCtot values. As a result, 14 (7 obtained from Datasets_1.67, 7 obtained from Datasets_3.41), 39 (21 obtained from Datasets_1.67, 18 obtained from Datasets_3.41) and 50 (27 obtained from Datasets_1.67, 23 obtained from Datasets_3.41) wavebands were selected from the RS data, FDS data and SDS data, respectively, as the EWs for LCCtot prediction of navel orange leaves. After that, PLSR and ANN predictive models were established using full spectra, and OLSR and SLR predictive models were built using the selected EWs. The experimental results demonstrated that these various regression methods were useful for estimating LCCtot in the order of PLSR models established using full spectra from RS data (F-RS-PLSR) > PLSR models established using full spectra from SDS data (F-SDS-PLSR) > PLSR models established using full spectra from FDS data (F-FDS-PLSR) > SLR models established using EWs by RS data (EWs-RS-SLR). However, models built with ANN and OLSR, where the RPD values were less than 3, cause the models to be inaccurate. Finally, in comparison, the F-RS-PLSR model exhibited the best performance of LCCtot estimation; with the number of principal components (Pcs) = 5, this model provided high values of the R2 of calibration (C-R2) = 0.92 and the R2 of validation (V-R2) = 0.96, small values of the RMSE of calibration (C-RMSE)=0.05 mg/g and the RMSE of validation (V-RMSE) = 0.19 mg/g, and sufficient the RPD of calibration (C-RPD)=17.00 and the RPD of validation (V-RPD)=3.63 values. Overall, the best modeling method was PLSR.

Therefore, we propose a deep learning-based framework for damage detection, which comprises signal processing and damage recognition modules. The signal processing module is introduced to denoise the noisy signals collected from sensors and process the denoised signals via fast Fourier transform. The damage recognition module is characterized by a novel network with the architecture of encoder-decoder-encoder. We train the network with only undamaged samples to capture the pattern in the undamaged state. In the testing stage, given an unknown damage state, we feed damaged samples into the trained network to quantify it by outputting the corresponding probability of damage. We conduct experiments to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed framework with a dataset of a building subjected to excitations.

A very particular state of fatigue, cognitive fatigue, drastically influences sustained attention and focus.

We aim to evaluate the effects of mechanical massage under the influence of binaural beats brain massage on mental fatigue recovery aided by an ensemble Machine Learning model. The experimental paradigm employed to induce cognitive fatigue includes digital lessons such as picture recognition, digit span, Stroop color and word, sustained attention to response, and N-back test. After extensive features extraction, Ridge, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear, quadratic, Radial Basis Function (RBF), and sigmoid kernel, K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Random Forest (RF), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) classifiers are employed. An ensemble algorithm, particularly using the hard voting method is employed that combines the forecasts of multiple classifiers to make a final decision, where each classifier casts one vote for a given input, and the class with the majority of votes is selected as the final prediction. This approach leverages the strength of each classifier, resulting in better overall performance than any single model alone. The Random Forest classifier aligns with the ensemble’s final decision 94.6% of the time, which indicates its significant contribution to the ensemble model out of all classifiers.

Enhancing fNIRS classification can improve the performance of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). Currently, deep neural networks (DNNs) do not consider the inherent delayed hemodynamic responses of fNIRS signals, which causes many optimization and application problems. Considering the kernel size and receptive field of convolutions, delayed hemodynamic responses as domain knowledge are introduced into fNIRS classification, and a concise and efficient model named fNIRSNet is proposed. We empirically summarize three design guidelines for fNIRSNet. In subject-specific and subject-independent experiments, fNIRSNet outperforms other DNNs on open-access datasets. Specifically, fNIRSNet with only 498 parameters is 6.58% higher than convolutional neural network (CNN) with millions of parameters on mental arithmetic tasks and the floating-point operations (FLOPs) of fNIRSNet are much lower than CNN. Therefore, fNIRSNet is friendly to practical applications and reduces the hardware cost of BCI systems. It may inspire more research on knowledge-driven models for fNIRS BCIs.

The market value of fish varies greatly depending on the fat content. For example, mackerels with high-fat content are a high priority for business transactions in Japanese fisheries. The fat content is commonly measured manually with special equipment using the near-infrared spectroscopy, which increases costs and reduces productivity. It is ideal to estimate the fat content automatically using inexpensive equipment such as ordinary cameras. However, fat content estimation from fish images is a challenging task because the difference in fat content appears only as a slight difference in their appearance. To tackle this problem, we propose to use not only RGB images but also depth images to utilize shape information as well as the textures. To detect subtle differences in texture and shape, we propose a convolutional neural network that extracts and concatenates features from part images, such as the head, body, and tail of a mackerel image. Color-texture and three-dimensional shape features extracted from RGB and depth images, respectively, are combined to estimate the fat content.

Machine learning (ML) can play an important role in this effort, but its application to SIF retrieval methods is in part hindered by the need for time-consuming radiative transfer modeling to account for atmospheric effects. In this work, we address this difficulty and develop a fast and accurate physics-based ML emulator of at-sensor radiances around the O$_{2}$-A absorption band for the space-based DESIS and the airborne HyPlant spectrometers. Different ML models are trained on an extensive set of simulated spectra encompassing a wide range of atmosphere, geometry, surface, and sensor configurations. A fourth-degree polynomial model is found to perform best, presenting errors at or below 10% of typical SIF at-sensor radiances and a prediction time per sample spectrum of 10$-$20 μs. Using data acquired with the HyPlant instrument, the proposed model is also shown to be able to match very closely the measured spectra. We illustrate how to improve further the accuracy of the emulator and how to generalize it to other sensors using the particular case of ESA's FLEX space mission. Our findings suggest that physics-based emulators can be efficiently used for the development of ML-based SIF retrieval methods by generating large training datasets in short time and by enabling a fast simulation step for self-supervised retrieval schemes.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3457231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10670589","Hyperspectral sensors;machine learning;radiative transfer;solar-induced fluorescence","Atmospheric modeling;Terrestrial atmosphere;Instruments;Geometry;Absorption;Optical surface waves;Polynomials","","","","33","CCBYNCND","10 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed solution presents clear advantages against state-of-the-art systems in terms of higher effectiveness and reasonable efficiency. The main disadvantage of the proposed approach is that it relies on knowing the injection time, i.e., the instant in time when the contaminant is injected into the wastewater. For this reason, the developed system also includes a finite state machine tool able to infer the exact time instant when the substance is injected. The entire system is presented and discussed in detail. Furthermore, several variants of the proposed processing technique are also presented to assess the sensitivity to the number of used samples and the corresponding promptness/computational burden of the system.

However, the reproducibility and comparability of fNIRS studies is still an open issue in the scientific community. The paucity of experimental practices and the lack of clear guidelines regarding fNIRS use contribute to undermining the reproducibility of results. For this reason, much effort is now directed at assessing the impact of heterogeneous experimental practices in creating divergent fNIRS results. The current work aims to assess differences in fNIRS signal quality in data collected by two different labs in two different cohorts: Singapore (N=74) and Italy (N=84). Random segments of 20s were extracted from each channel in each participant’s NIRScap and 1280 deep features were obtained using a deep learning model trained to classify the quality of fNIRS data. Two datasets were generated: ALL dataset (segments with bad and good data quality) and GOOD dataset (segments with good quality). Each dataset was divided into train and test partitions, which were used to train and evaluate the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model in classifying the cohorts from signal quality features. Results showed that the SG cohort had significantly higher occurrences of bad signal quality in the majority of the fNIRS channels. Moreover, the SVM correctly classified the cohorts when using the ALL dataset. However, the performance dropped almost completely (except for five channels) when the SVM had to classify the cohorts using data from the GOOD dataset. These results suggest that fNIRS raw data obtained by different labs might possess different levels of quality as well as different latent characteristics beyond quality per se. The current study highlights the importance of defining clear guidelines in the conduction of fNIRS experiments in the reporting of data quality in fNIRS manuscripts.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3458396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10677394","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;reproducibility;signal-quality;standardization","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Reproducibility of results;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Psychology;Pipelines;Neuroimaging","Humans;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared;Male;Female;Adult;Support Vector Machine;Reproducibility of Results;Young Adult;Deep Learning;Cohort Studies;Italy;Algorithms;Functional Neuroimaging;Data Accuracy","1","","35","CCBY","11 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All participants completed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) tasks designed to assess word expression ability (report task) and word comprehension ability (point task). General linear model (GLM) analysis was conducted to compare activation differences across fNIRS channels between the two groups.

In wavelength division multiplexing, each FBG occupies a certain wavelength range; therefore, the number of FBGs that can be installed is limited by the wavelength band of the light source. To address this issue, methods for overlapping multiple FBGs of the same wavelength within a single occupied wavelength range have been studied. This contributes to improving the limit of multipoint FBG’s manifold. However, this method results in the complex overlapping of multiple FBG reflectance spectra, making it difficult to accurately measure the peak wavelengths of individual FBGs using conventional peak detection methods. Therefore, we developed a peak detection process using CNN, which is suitable for identifying unique feature data. Each FBG of the same wavelength was characterized to have a unique spectral shape by assigning a different full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values to each. We introduced noise-additive learning, a well-known method of data augmentation that increases tolerance to variations in the experimental signal. As a result, the standard deviation for peak wavelength detection significantly improved to 2.8 pm and the strain measurements with three complex overlapping FBGs were successfully demonstrated. The CNN model is the first to solve the problem of three overlapping FBGs for arbitrary wavelength changes. Furthermore, the developed peak detection process was found to be applicable to measurements that combined multiplexing of FBGs of either identical or different wavelengths.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3262494","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:20K14754); Nihon University College of Science and Technology for Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090418","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);deep learning;fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs);optical fiber sensors;wavelength division multiplexing","Fiber gratings;Convolutional neural networks;Wavelength measurement;Optical variables measurement;Training data;Numerical models;Reflectivity","","11","","33","CCBY","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The research of near-infrared spectral modeling method becomes the core of analyzing NIRS. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction model for NIRS, this paper proposes a novel sparse classification mechanism by designing appropriate regularization factors. The existing supervised dictionary learning methods have been proposed for classification aim and increasing its accuracy, the proposed method addresses some defects existing in this area through designing the representation-constrained term and the coefficients incoherence term, and the added two terms can get the reconstruction error of coding coefficients and correlations between similar samples by sharing dictionary under more stable control. Then, based on the proposed model, a supervised class-specific dictionary learning algorithm is developed by choosing appropriate samples with class labels. Finally, a classification scheme integrating the novel sparse model is designed to exploit such discriminative information.

Researchers widely recognize that exploiting spectral-spatial data outperforms using spectral pixel-wise methods. Most of the work focuses on machine learning techniques to address issues with HSI categorization. The semi-supervised learning model, for example, was utilized in early research to address the issue of the expenses associated with training samples during HSI classification. Nevertheless, these approaches and techniques have certain drawbacks. The suggested framework must be improved in terms of hardware and computational capacity to enhance security. While integrated patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) can help overcome these issues, due to the complicated geographical distribution of many targets, there are some downsides, such as using spectra as odorless vectors. The supervised learning techniques categorize the inputs by using a collection of appropriate examples for each class, referred to as training samples. For this purpose, samples must be obtained, however, the process is expensive and time-consuming. Deep learning techniques for evaluating spatial spectrum data have significantly advanced, yet security challenges remain in remote sensing with HSI. In this article, we introduce a novel HSI classification method, termed Deep-Detect, which leverages deep learning models with attention mechanisms to tackle these challenges. We use two weighting factors that may be obtained flexibly during the training phase to integrate both spectral and spatial properties, whose importance differs for various objects and scenarios. Additionally, we proposed a spatial and spectral fully convolutional networks (Spe-FCNs) attention mechanism that focuses attention on the input patches’ most informative regions. To verify performance, we used the northern Italy dataset from Pavia University and compared our proposed model with state-of-the-art HSI classification models.

Magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MREPT) is an imaging modality that reconstructs EPs by the radio-frequency field in an MRI system. MREPT reconstructs EPs by solving analytic models numerically based on Maxwell’s equations. Most MREPT methods suffer from artifacts caused by inaccuracy of the hypotheses behind the models, and/or numerical errors. These artifacts can be mitigated by adding coefficients to stabilize the models, however, the selection of such coefficient has been empirical, which limit its medical application. Alternatively, end-to-end Neural networks-based MREPT (NN-MREPT) learns to reconstruct the EPs from training samples, circumventing Maxwell’s equations. However, due to its pattern-matching nature, it is difficult for NN-MREPT to produce accurate reconstructions for new samples. In this work, we proposed a physics-coupled NN for MREPT (PCNN-MREPT), in which an analytic model, cr-MREPT, works with diffusion and convection coefficients, learned by NNs from the difference between the reconstructed and ground-truth EPs to reduce artifacts. With two simulated datasets, three generalization experiments in which test samples deviate gradually from the training samples, and one noise-robustness experiment were conducted. The results show that the proposed PCNN-MREPT achieves higher accuracy than two representative analytic methods. Moreover, compared with an end-to-end NN-MREPT, the proposed method attained higher accuracy in two critical generalization tests. This is an important step to practical MREPT medical diagnoses.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2022.3172220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9771095","MREPT;machine learning;neural network;physics coupled","Image reconstruction;Physics;Magnetic resonance imaging;Artificial neural networks;Conductivity;Training;Mathematical models","Algorithms;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Neural Networks, Computer;Phantoms, Imaging;Physics;Tomography","9","","45","CCBYNCND","9 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is usually 1st diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Various researchers introduced different statistical tools to identify children with ADHD based on phonotype, vision, and image-based data. The main causes of children with ADHD are still unknown and its diagnostic accuracy rate remains low. There is still some scopes to establish valid biomarkers for ADHD and improve the classification accuracy, which will help for children enhance their quality of life. This study aimed to establish and determine potential biomarkers for children with ADHD and then proposed a machine learning (ML)-based ADHD detection system. A multicenter approach was employed to collect Reverse Stroop Task (RST) data, including age, behavioral, and physiological indicators from 72 children with ADHD (aged 6–13 years) and 171 typically developing (TD) children. Moreover, we also collected the signal information from each subject using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs) and quantified the change in prefrontal cortex oxygenated hemoglobin during RST. At the same time, we also computed the mean signal for every channel during the last 20 seconds of RST. We selected 70% of the dataset as a training set (ADHD: 51 and TD: 120) and the remaining dataset was used as a testing set (ADHD: 21 and TD: 51). To determine the potential biomarkers for ADHD, we employed independent t-test (p<0.05) on training data that contained behavioral, physiological, and signal indicators. These significant biomarkers were used to train six ML-based approaches, including support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, neural network, linear discriminate analysis and random forest (RF) with 10-fold cross-validation and repeated 10 times for selecting the optimum value of hyperparameters using the classification accuracy. The trained ML-based approaches were used to predict children with ADHD and validate their performance on the testing data. The experimental results showed that the RF-based model obtained a classification accuracy of 91.67%, sensitivity of 95.92%, specificity of 82.61%, precision of 92.16%, F1-Score of 94.00%, Cohen’s Kappa of 80.38%, geometric mean of 89.02%, positive likelihood ratio of 5.51%, negative likelihood ratio of 0.05%, and area under the curve of 0.955.

In this work, we present a Computer Vision-based system which is able to automatically count and classify microplastic particles (1-5 mm) into five different visual classes. After cleaning a collected sample in the lab, the proposed system makes use of a pair of its images with different characteristics. The procedure includes a segmentation step, which is based on the Sauvola thresholding method, followed by a feature extraction and classification step. Different features and classifiers are evaluated as well as a deep learning approach. The system is tested on 12 different beach samples with a total of 2507 microplastic particles. The particles of each sample were manually counted and sorted by an expert. This data represents the ground truth, which is compared later with the results of the automatic processing proposals to evaluate their accuracy. The difference in the number of particles is 34 (1.4%) and the error in their classification is less than 4% for all types except for the line shapes particles.

Our overall framework consists of three main stages. Firstly, in the model training stage, we explore dataset generation in a multi-cell environment and train a machine learning (ML) model using the federated learning (FL) architecture. Unlike the existing studies on FL for wireless that presume datasets are readily available for training, we propose an end-to-end architecture that directly integrates wireless dataset generation, which involves capturing I/Q samples from over-the-air signals in a multi-cell environment, into the FL training process. To this purpose, we propose a multi-label classification problem for wideband spectrum sensing to detect multiple spectrum holes simultaneously based on the I/Q samples collected locally by the UAVs. In the traditional FL that employs federated averaging (FedAvg) as the aggregating method, each UAV is assigned an equal weight during model aggregation. However, due to the differences in wireless channels observed at each UAV in a multi-cell environment, the received signal powers and collected datasets at different UAV locations could be significantly different, which could degrade the FL performance using equal weights. To address this issue, we propose a proportional weighted federated averaging method (pwFedAvg) in which the aggregating weights are proportional to the received signal powers at each UAV, thereby integrating the intrinsic properties of wireless channels into the FL algorithm. Secondly, in the collaborative spectrum inference stage, we propose a collaborative spectrum fusion strategy that is compatible with the unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM) ecosystem. In particular, we improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing results by combining the multi-label classification results from the individual UAVs by performing spectrum fusion at a central server. Finally, in the spectrum scheduling stage, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to dynamically allocate the detected spectrum holes to the secondary users. To evaluate the proposed methods, we establish a comprehensive simulation framework that generates a near-realistic synthetic dataset using MATLAB LTE toolbox by incorporating base station (BS) locations in a chosen area of interest, performing ray-tracing, and emulating the primary user’s channel usage in terms of I/Q samples. This evaluation methodology provides a flexible framework to generate large spectrum datasets that could be used for developing ML/AI-based spectrum management solutions for aerial devices.","2831-316X","","10.1109/TMLCN.2025.3540747","National Aeronautics and Space Administration(grant numbers:80NSSC20M0261); NSF(grant numbers:1955561,2212565,2323189); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10879292","UAV-based spectrum sensing;collaborative inference;federated learning (FL);reinforcement learning (RL);UAS traffic management (UTM)","Sensors;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Wideband;Training;Collaboration;Machine learning;Numerical models;Dynamic scheduling","","","","59","CCBY","11 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we propose early and late fusion methods to recognize five facial expressions (angry, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised) using different combinations from a publicly available database (VIRI) with visible, infrared, and multispectral dynamic imaging (MSX) images and the (NVIE) database. A distinctive feature is the use of concatenation and combining techniques to combine ResNet-18 with transfer learning (TL) to create a model that is significantly more accurate than individual models. In the early fusion, we concatenated features from the modalities and classified facial expressions (FEs). In the late fusion, we combined the outputs of the modalities using weighted sums. For this purpose, we used different weighting factors depending on the accuracy of the individual models. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed the previous works by providing an accuracy of 83.33% when we trained the model (1-step training). Through further fine-tuning (3-step training), we obtained an improved performance of 84.44%. We conducted additional experiments by combining them with another modality (MSX) available in the database. By performing experiments with an additional modality (MSX), we obtained improved performance, which confirms that the additional modality combined with existing modalities can help improve the performance of fusion models for facial expression recognition. We also experimented by changing the backbones (Vgg-16, ShuffleNetv2, MobileNetv2, and GhostNet) in addition to ResNet-18 for visible and MSX data.

However, due to the variety and changeability of buildings, identifying building rooftops based on remote sensing images is still a challenge. Taking advantage of hyperspectral remote sensing imagery and spectroscopy, we propose a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) approach with pure pixel index (PPI) constraints, named CNNP, to identify building rooftops materials. The framework, which accepts two kinds of data cubes as input data, extract spectral and spatial information by using 1D CNN and 3-D CNNs with different kernel size, respectively. After the feature extraction, aiming to identify different building materials, the output of the top layer is the input to a classifier in a ratio decided upon by the PPI of the central pixel. To verify the effectiveness, we use Hyperion and push-broom hyperspectral imager (PHI) data sets that represent high and low spatial resolution images to compare our proposed method with other traditional remote sensing image classification approaches, such as support vector machine; stacked auto-encoders; deep belief network; 1D CNN; and 2-D CNN; 3-D CNN; MiniGCN. The quantitative and qualitative results show that compared to otherrepresentative methods, CNNP achieves better performance, for both kinds of data, on Hyperion and PHI data sets with overall accuracy of 98.83% and 99.82%, respectively.

The information gained from the spectrum analysis can be further used for different applications, which include quality of transmission estimation (QoT). Accurate QoT estimation allows to maximize network capacity and minimize margins either through reconfiguration or during the deployment. Analytical solutions for QoT estimation require exact knowledge of the parameters (e.g. fiber lengths, attenuation, non-linearity coefficients), which are not always exactly known in practice especially in multi-vendor networks. Machine learning has shown to be able to handle such parameter-agnostic scenarios. In this paper, we experimentally compare different machine learning based QoT estimators to our developed spectral data driven estimators as well as comparing it to a new approach of using automated feature extraction from the spectrum by a variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE-based estimation approach is experimentally validated and the required optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) resolutions are investigated. The spectral data driven estimators show to be superior regarding both R$^{2}$-score and mean absolute error. Furthermore, the automated feature extraction using the VAE is shown to be a suitable option for accurate optical performance monitoring without demodulation and QoT estimation.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2023.3271860","CELTIC-NEXT(grant numbers:C2019/3-4); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(grant numbers:16KIS128); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10114628","Agnostic networks;optical performance monitoring;quality of transmission estimation;recurrent neural networks;variational autoencoder","Estimation;Logic gates;Signal to noise ratio;Optical fiber networks;Microprocessors;Optical noise;Adaptive optics","","6","","30","CCBY","2 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the recent advances in machine learning algorithms, short- and long-term traffic fluctuations can be forecasted. Consequently, the backbone optical network can be adapted to traffic changes aiming to improve its performance. However, an important challenge lies in developing effective optimization methods capable of adapting to traffic changes to leverage the knowledge about the traffic. To this end, this paper addresses the time-varying traffic in spectrally-spatially flexible optical networks (SS-FONs), which are a promising technology to mitigate backbone network requirements of vast traffic volume transmission. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we introduce a new traffic prediction method using multioutput regression and temporal features to forecast traffic between all node pairs and integrate this prediction method into an optimization framework developed for dynamic resource allocation in translucent SS-FONs with time-varying traffic. Secondly, we evaluate potential network performance improvements from periodic lightpath reallocation through extensive numerical experiments. According to the results of experiments run on two representative optical network topologies, the proposed approach with periodic resource allocation allows achieving up to 7.8 percentage points reduction of bandwidth blocking compared to the reference scenario without reallocation. Consequently, the network requires up to 23.4% fewer transceivers to deliver the same traffic in considered scenarios and thus the power consumption savings are provided.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3441522","National Science Center (NCN), Poland(grant numbers:2019/35/B/ST7/04272); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10632183","Machine learning;routing and spectrum allocation;translucent optical networks;time-varying traffic;traffic prediction","Optical fiber networks;Resource management;Routing;Optimization;Topology;Predictive models;Heuristic algorithms","","","","76","CCBY","9 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to ageing and cyclic operation, many hidden defects exist under insulation, such as corrosion and delamination. If these defects are not promptly detected and restored, the growth of defects causes a catastrophic loss. Therefore, an effective inspection technique using non-destructive testing (NDT) to detect the underneath defect is required. The ability of microwave signals to penetrate and interact with the inner structure within composites makes them a promising candidate for composite inspection. In the case of GFRP, the random patterns cause permittivity variations that influence the propagation of the microwave signals, which results in a blurred spatial image making the assessment of the material's state difficult. In this research, a novel microwave NDT technique is presented based on k-means unsupervised machine learning for defect detection in composites. At present, the defect evaluation using an unsupervised machine learning-based microwave NDT technique is not reported elsewhere. The unsupervised machine learning is employed to enhance the imaging efficiency and defect detection in GFRP. The technique is based on scanning the composite material with an open-ended rectangular waveguide operating from 18 to 26.5 GHz with 101 frequency points. The influence of the permittivity variations on the reflected coefficients due to the random patterns of GFRP is mitigated by measuring the mean of a set of the adjacent points at each operating frequency point using a small rectangular window. The measured data is converted to the time domain using a fast inverse Fourier transform (IFFT) to provide significant features and increase the signal resolution to 201-time steps. K-means algorithm is utilized to cluster the given features into the defect and defect-free regions in GFRP. The findings presented in this paper demonstrate the benefits of an unsupervised machine learning to detect a defect down to 1 mm, which is a considerable contribution over any existing defect inspection technique in composites.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3048147","Ministry of Education Malaysia Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS)(grant numbers:203.PELECT.6071430); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311119","Unsupervised machine learning;k-means;microwave NDT;defect detection","Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave imaging;Insulation;Inspection;Microwave measurement;Machine learning;Microwave radiometry","","46","","44","CCBY","30 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Methods: In three non-human primates, we modulated cerebral perfusion pressure beyond the limits of autoregulation. Cerebral blood flow and volume were measured with diffuse correlation spectroscopy and near-infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Results: We show that impedance can be used to identify the lower and upper limits of autoregulation. Conclusions: This impedance method may be an alternative method to measure autoregulation and a way of assessing cerebral health non-invasively at the clinical bedside.","2644-1276","","10.1109/OJEMB.2023.3236267","Center for Machine Learning and Health Fellowship, the American Heart Association(grant numbers:17SDG33700047); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R21-EB024675); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015702","Cerebral autoregulation;cerebral hemodynamics;cerebrovascular impedance;diffuse correlation spectroscopy;near-infrared spectroscopy","Impedance;Detectors;Optical fiber devices;Frequency measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Impedance measurement;Cerebrum;Hemodynamics;Infrared spectra;Circulatory system","","2","","37","CCBY","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, owing to the irregular and unordered natures of point clouds, it is relatively difficult for classification model to distinguish some objects with similar geometry by single-modal data only. Fortunately, additional gain information, e.g., color spectrum which can be complementary to geometric information, is able to effectively promote the classification effect. Therefore, the design of fusion strategy is a critical part in model construction. In this article, aiming to capture more abstract semantic information for color spectrum data, we elaborate a color spectrum fusion (CSF) module. It can be flexibly integrated into a classification pipeline with just negligible parameters. Then, we expand data fusion thoughts for point clouds and color spectrum and investigate three possible fusion strategies. Accordingly, we develop three architectures to construct CSF-Nets. Ultimately, by taking a weighted cross entropy loss, we can train our CSF-Nets in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two extensively used datasets: Vaihingen 3D and LASDU show that the presented three fusion approaches all can improve the performance, while the earlier fusion strategy performs the best. Besides, compared with other well-performed methods, CSF-Net is still able to achieve satisfactory performance on overall accuracy and m$F_{1}$-score indicator. This also validates the effectiveness of our multimodal fusion network.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3133602","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61725105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645363","Airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud;color spectrum information;deep learning;multimodal fusion;semantic labeling","Image color analysis;Point cloud compression;Three-dimensional displays;Semantics;Feature extraction;Labeling;Deep learning","","7","","67","CCBY","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The method is applicable when the SoC is estimated in classes through Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and is based on two operating stages: i) the experimental characterization of the real behavior of the considered batteries, ii) a time–Accuracy optimization based on suitable feature selection and Machine Learning approaches. In detail, as for the ii) phase, fixed the number of classes in which the SoC is estimated, the proposed measurement method finds the minimum number of impedance spectrum frequency measurements useful for SoC estimation. This is a big issue for BMS designers since in SoC estimation performed by EIS the measurement time is typically greater than some minutes if no optimization is considered. A possible strategy to reduce the required time for SoC estimation could be using Feature Selection (FS) techniques. In our method the FS is implemented using different combinations of search algorithms and fitness functions. Since FS strongly depends on the experimental set–up, the uncertainty of the measurement system, and the classifier adopted for the data–driving evaluation model, the proposed method is flexible and customizable depending on the specific applications. For this reason, the method is divided into steps where the BMS designers define the requirements based on their needs and their hardware. Also the output FS could be adapted to the different exigencies because the selected features could be different if more emphasis is on increasing classification Accuracy or decreasing the measurement time. Hence, we suggest two application scenarios: in the first one, the only requirement is increasing the classification Accuracy rather than the measurement time optimization. The second scenario has both a classification Accuracy target and lowering the measurement time. We also noted that the proposed method is useful also for increasing the overall classification Accuracy because naturally excludes the features that deceive the classifiers. As an application for the proposed method, we developed an automatic measurement system and performed an experimental campaign on seven Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries. The experimental results show that the proposed approach, for all the considered combinations, significantly reduces the measurement time required for EIS while maintaining high SoC estimation Accuracy. Furthermore, for all the obtained solutions, the effectiveness of our approach was confirmed by the significant savings in measurement time. In particular, the best solution reduces from 4 minutes when using all features to about 1.5 seconds with the selected features.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3308029","Italian National Center for Sustainable Mobility (MOST); Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR) in 2022–2025; “Innovazione per il Controllo avanzato e la gestione di Grid Energetiche” Project within the Puglia Fondo Europeo Sviluppo Regionale (FESR) 2014–2020(grant numbers:CUP B81B22000020007); Power4Future S.p.A; Italian Ministry of Enterprises and Made in Italy (MISE)(grant numbers:CDS000944); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10227269","Batteries;state of charge estimation;electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;feature selection","Time measurement;Batteries;Estimation;Frequency measurement;Battery charge measurement;Feature extraction;Time-frequency analysis;State of charge;Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","","7","","24","CCBYNCND","23 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hybrid BCI systems using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have received significant attention for overcoming the limitations of EEG- and fNIRS-standalone BCI systems. However, most hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI studies have focused on late fusion because of discrepancies in their temporal resolutions and recording locations. Despite the enhanced performance of hybrid BCIs, late fusion methods have difficulty in extracting correlated features in both EEG and fNIRS signals. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a deep learning-based early fusion structure, which combines two signals before the fully-connected layer, called the fNIRS-guided attention network (FGANet). First, 1D EEG and fNIRS signals were converted into 3D EEG and fNIRS tensors to spatially align EEG and fNIRS signals at the same time point. The proposed fNIRS-guided attention layer extracted a joint representation of EEG and fNIRS tensors based on neurovascular coupling, in which the spatially important regions were identified from fNIRS signals, and detailed neural patterns were extracted from EEG signals. Finally, the final prediction was obtained by weighting the sum of the prediction scores of the EEG and fNIRS-guided attention features to alleviate performance degradation owing to delayed fNIRS response. In the experimental results, the FGANet significantly outperformed the EEG-standalone network. Furthermore, the FGANet has 4.0% and 2.7% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithms in mental arithmetic and motor imagery tasks, respectively.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3149899","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)(grant numbers:2020M3C1B8081320,2020R1C1C1011857); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9706459","Brain-computer interface (BCI);deep learning;electroencephalography (EEG);functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS);hybrid BCI;fNIRS-guided attention networks","Electroencephalography;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Tensors;Task analysis;Electrodes","Algorithms;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electroencephalography;Humans","37","","57","CCBY","7 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, both empirical equations and machine learning regressors perform the prediction using only the acoustic information collected at the time when one wants to know the wind speed or the rainfall intensity. At most, averages are made between spectra measured at subsequent times (spectral compounding) or between predictions obtained at subsequent times (prediction compounding). In this article, it is proposed to exploit the temporal correlation inherent in the phenomena being predicted, as has already been done in methods that forecast wind and rainfall from their values (and sometimes those of other meteorological quantities) in the recent past. A special architecture of recurrent neural networks, the long short-term memory, is used along with a data set composed of about 16 months of underwater noise measurements (acquired every 10 min, simultaneously with wind and rain measurements above the sea surface) to demonstrate that the introduction of temporal correlation brings significant advantages, improving the accuracy and reducing the problems met in the widely adopted memoryless prediction performed by random forest regression.

Because of the relatively large ΔEC of t-ZrO2, the window of the flat band voltage (VFB) shift extracted from charge trapping capacitors was enlarged by 591.9 mV more than the one using p-ZrO2 as the charge trapping layer. Retention was also improved by 10.4% after 105 s in the t-ZrO2 case. Finally, we fabricated the CTMTs with the gate stack of the t-ZrO2 case and demonstrated their characteristics as synaptic devices. With the optimization of pulse schemes, we reduced the nonlinear factors of depression (αd) and potentiation (αp) from -6.72 and 6.47 to 0.03 and 0.01 respectively, enlarged the ON/OFF ratio from 15.6 to 70.4 and increased the recognition accuracy from 27.6% to 86.5% simultaneously.","2168-6734","","10.1109/JEDS.2020.2993859","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 107-2221-E-009-095-MY3); Center for the Semiconductor Technology Research(grant numbers:MOST-108-3017-F-009-003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091548","Germanium;high-κ dielectrics;multilayer perceptron;neural network hardware;synaptic device;zirconium oxide","Logic gates;Crystals;Neural networks;Aluminum oxide;Capacitors;Depression;X-ray scattering","","2","","23","CCBY","13 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, various degrees of data gaps exist in current microwave SM products. Therefore, this article proposed a spatiotemporal attention-based residual deep network (STARN) to reconstruct gaps of the daily SM data from the Climate Change Initiative program of the European Space Agency (ESA CCI) over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) during unfrozen seasons (May to September) from 2001 to 2021. The developed model is an end-to-end residual network embedded with three attention modules to comprehensively consider the potential relationship between SM and surface variables. Evaluation results revealed that the proposed model could well reconstruct SM gaps with an overall median R and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) values of 0.52 and 0.054 m3/m3, while the overall median R and ubRMSE values for the ESA CCI SM were 0.41 and 0.058 m3/m3. Besides, comparison with five baseline methods (e.g., the artificial neural network, convolutional neural network, extreme gradient boosting, long-short term memory, and DCT-PLS model) indicated that the STARN model had certain advantages over the five baseline models with higher correlation and more reasonable distribution patterns. The R/ubRMSE values for the five models were 0.38/0.057, 0.34/0.058, 0.40/0.058, 0.41/0.056, and 0.41/0.058, respectively. The pretraining using the ERA5-Land SM data could further improve the accuracy of generated seamless SM data since the ERA5-Land and ESA CCI SM complemented each other to a certain extent on the QTP. In summary, by leveraging the spatiotemporal information and attention modules, the STARN model showed great potentials in SM gap filling.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3284841","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41930754); Key R&D Program of Zhejiang(grant numbers:2022C03078); Fund for Less Developed Regions; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:32060370); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10151924","Attention mechanism;Climate Change Initiative program of the European Space Agency (ESA CCI);gap filling;soil moisture (SM);Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP);transfer learning","Climate change;Soil moisture;European Space Agency;Transfer learning;Deep learning;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Surface reconstruction;Residual neural networks;Meteorology;Convolutional neural networks","","1","","48","CCBY","14 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

HSRS comprises acquisition of digital images in many narrow, contiguous spectral bands through the visible, Near Infrared (NIR), Thermal Infrared (TIR), and Mid-Infrared (MIR) regions of electromagnetic spectrum. For the application of agricultural areas, remote sensing methods can be examined and implemented to the advantage of continuous and quantitative monitoring.

The presented ACC-CBOEFF technique exploits the feature fusion and parameter tuning concepts to determine different types of crops on the HSI.

Although recent advancements in deep learning have largely embraced supervised learning approaches, they often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data. Unsupervised learning, therefore, emerges as a promising alternative, yet its potential has not been fully realized in current methodologies. This article proposes an innovative unsupervised learning framework employing a momentum contrastive learning-based transformer network specifically tailored for hyperspectral target detection. The proposed approach innovatively combines transformer-based encoder and momentum encoder networks to enhance feature extraction capabilities, adeptly capturing both local spectral details and long-range spectral dependencies through the novel overlapping spectral patch embedding and a cross-token feedforward layer. This dual-encoder design significantly improves the model's ability to discern relevant spectral features amidst complex backgrounds. Through unsupervised momentum contrastive learning, a dynamically updated queue of negative sample features is utilized so that the model can demonstrate superior spectral discriminability. This is further bolstered by a unique background suppression mechanism leveraging nonlinear transformations of cosine similarity detection results, with two nonlinearly pull-up operations, significantly enhancing target detection sensitivity, where the nonlinearly operations are the exponential function with its normalization and the power function with its normalization, respectively. Comparative analysis against seven state-of-the-art hyperspectral target detection methods across four real hyperspectral images demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method for hyperspectral target detection, with an increase in detection accuracy and a competitive computational efficiency. An extensive ablation study further validates the critical components of the proposed framework, confirming its comprehensive capability and applicability in hyperspectral target detection scenarios.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3387985","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801075,42271355); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:2022-MS-160); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M670723); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3132023238); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10497838","Hyperspectral imagery (HSI);momentum contrastive learning;target detection;transformer;unsupervised learning","Transformers;Object detection;Hyperspectral imaging;Feature extraction;Self-supervised learning;Training;Unsupervised learning","","11","","60","CCBYNCND","12 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As differences between normal skin tissue and pigmentation tissue (and even a change in pigmentation development) can be detected by their optical properties, this paper presents a new, potentially noninvasive approach for skin cancer detection. Since each wavelength has different penetration depth into the tissue and different absorption, the goal was to check whether a combination of information obtained from five different wavelengths, can increase the detection probability and reduce the false positive probability, compared to using only one wavelength. Temporal tracking of back-reflected secondary speckle patterns generated while illuminating the tested area with several lasers and applying periodic vibrations to the surface via a controlled vibration source at several stimulation frequencies. As a sequel to the previous work conducted in our laboratory which investigated pigmented lesions interaction with one light source, this work deals with increasing the number of parameters that are being looked at and considered at the same time. Using five wavelengths, 9 vibration frequencies and 19 signal analysis parameters, ex-vivo experiments were performed on porcine skin tissues and were analyzed using artificial intelligence tools which could detect the strong features for each wavelength individually. Combining the wavelengths produced impressive results compared to the results by each wavelength separately: both types of errors, false positive and false negative, decreased to less than 2%. Such a significant change in its impact on patients shows the value of this method. This paper shows the possibility of optically separating normal skin from pigmentation tissue, by using the advantages of multi-spectral optimization. This is a necessary proof of concept as a preliminary step toward our future experiments, which may differentiate between different types of pigmentation, and even malignancy and benign tissues.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2020.3048015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9310312","Skin optical properties;pigmented lesions;tissue probing;ex-vivo;optics;speckle;lasers;optimization;machine learning","Skin;Lesions;Pigmentation;Cameras;Speckle;Vibrations;Correlation","","1","","23","CCBYNCND","29 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study focuses on simulating the kinematic state of a NACA65-010 self-propelled hydrofoil, operating under low Reynolds number uniform incoming flow, utilizing the immersed boundary method. Additionally, we investigate the alterations in the fish’s swimming performance when it actively oscillates by observing the hydrodynamic performance of the model under various oscillation parameters. To streamline the numerical simulation process, we employ the long short-term memory network (LSTM), time-sequential convolutional network (TCN), and transformer model to predict the lift and thrust coefficients of the self-propelled hydrofoil. The outcomes demonstrate that both the trailing edge amplitude and vibration frequency significantly influence the model’s propulsion performance, enabling the hydrofoil to generate countercurrent thrust at low Reynolds numbers. Moreover, the average lift and thrust of the self-propelled hydrofoil exhibit gradual increases over time during the forward motion. The LSTM prediction model exhibits superior accuracy and goodness of fit in forecasting the hydrodynamic parameters, with an average absolute error of lift and thrust coefficients below 0.19 and a goodness-of-fit exceeding 0.968. Furthermore, the implementation of this model reduces the overall computational burden of the experimental process by 25%.

It follows the objective of this work as pain estimation through post-surgical trauma modeling and classification, to increase the needed reliability compared to measurements only. Methods: This article proposes (i) a recursive identification method to obtain the frequency response and parameterization using fractional-order impedance models (FOIM), and (ii) deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNN) classification algorithms using time-frequency data and spectrograms. The skin impedance measurements were conducted on 12 patients throughout the postanesthesia care in a proof-of-concept clinical trial. Recursive least-squares system identification was performed using a genetic algorithm for initializing the parametric model. The online parameter estimates were compared to the self-reported level by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for analysis and validation of the results. Alternatively, the inputs to CNNs were the spectrograms extracted from the time-frequency dataset, being pre-labeled in four intensities classes of pain during offline and online training with the NRS. Results: The tendency of nociception could be predicted by monitoring the changes in the FOIM parameters' values or by retraining online the network. Moreover, the tissue heterogeneity, assumed during nociception, could follow the NRS trends. The online predictions of retrained CNN have more specific trends to NRS than pain predicted by the offline population-trained CNN. Conclusion: We propose tailored online identification and deep learning for artefact corrupted environment. The results indicate estimations with the potential to avoid over-dosing due to the objectivity of the information. Significance: Models and artificial intelligence (AI) allow objective and personalized nociception-antinociception prediction in the patient safety era for the design and evaluation of closed-loop analgesia controllers.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2023.3274541","FWO Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Doctoral Fellowship(grant numbers:1184220N); BOF Bijzonder Onderzoeksfonds UGent Postdoctoral Fellowship(grant numbers:BOF22/PDO/008); FWO Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship(grant numbers:12X6823N); ERC Consolidator(grant numbers:AMICAS 101043225); European Commission; Romanian Ministry of Education and Research, CNCS-UEFISCDI(grant numbers:PN-III-P1-1.1-PD-2021-0204); Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitization(grant numbers:PNRR-III-C9-2022–I9,760018/27.01.2023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10198273","Artificial intelligence;closed-loop analgesia control;fractional order impedance model;frequency-domain analysis;recursive identification;spectroscopy","Pain;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Voltage measurement;Skin;Current measurement;Anesthesia","","2","","46","CCBY","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the successful landing of the Zhurong rover on the southern Utopian Planitia of Mars, the Mars Surface Composition Detector (MarSCoDe) on board the rover has started to analyze the material composition of the Martian surface by using the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). However, changes in instrument temperature and external environment during operation will cause spectral drift in LIBS data, leading to inaccurate material composition inversion results due to shifts in elemental characteristic peak positions. To address this problem, an adaptive spectral drift correction (ASDC) approach is proposed. By considering the distribution of characteristic peaks and drift differences between different elements, the proposed ASDC method corrects the spectral drift in LIBS science data according to an adaptive spectral segmentation strategy. Experimental results obtained on 36 real LIBS science data acquired over 19 exploration activities confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of lower average drift values, by comparing it with two reference methods. Taking the onboard calibration data as a reference, the average spectral drift values of the LIBS science data before and after applying ASDC decreased from 0.1012 nm to 0.0179 nm, 0.0926 nm to 0.0158 nm, and 0.1697 nm to 0.0103 nm in three LIBS channels, respectively.

The water index is a method applied to delineate the water features by combining the multispectral band images. This research proposes a novel index for extracting water features from multisensor MSIs named multisensor water index. The proposed index, along with existing indices, is applied on Landsat-8 OLI imageries, a comparative analysis is done, and it is found that the proposed index is outperforming with 99.77% accuracy. The proposed index was validated on other sensors, such as a series of Landsat (5, 7, 8, and 9), Sentinel-2, Resourcesat, and Modis satellite imagery, by mapping water features successfully. Furthermore, the proposed index maps marine pollution by discriminating phytoplankton and algal bloom from the water feature. It is observed that the increase in phytoplankton or algal bloom is the result of eutrophication. The blooming of phytoplankton and algae is on the surface of the water. Thus, it causes shading at the bottom of the marine ecosystem and negatively impacts the growth of seagrasses, dissolved oxygen levels, fish suffocation, water properties, and other bottom habitats. The three test sites, viz., lake Villarrica, lake Okeechobee, and the Atlantic Ocean, have been considered to study increasing phytoplankton and algal bloom.

Previous studies have shown the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for diagnosing MCI. However, preprocessing fNIRS measurements requires extensive experience to identify poor-quality segments. Moreover, few studies have explored how proper multi-dimensional fNIRS features influence the classification results of the disease. Thus, this study outlined a streamlined fNIRS preprocessing method to process fNIRS measurements and compared multi-dimensional fNIRS features with neural networks in order to explore how temporal and spatial factors affect the classification of MCI and cognitive normality. More specifically, this study proposed using Bayesian optimization-based auto hyperparameter tuning neural networks to evaluate 1D channel-wise, 2D spatial, and 3D spatiotemporal features of fNIRS measurements for detecting MCI patients. The highest test accuracies of 70.83%, 76.92%, and 80.77% were achieved for 1D, 2D, and 3D features, respectively. Through extensive comparisons, the 3D time-point oxyhemoglobin feature was proven to be a more promising fNIRS feature for detecting MCI by using an fNIRS dataset of 127 participants. Furthermore, this study presented a potential approach for fNIRS data processing, and the designed models required no manual hyperparameter tuning, which promoted the general utilization of fNIRS modality with neural network-based classification to detect MCI.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3236007","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC2001700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62073319,U1913601,61720106012); Beijing Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:Z211100007921021); Alliance of International Science Organizations (ANSO) Collaborative Research Project(grant numbers:ANSO-CR-PP-2020-03); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Science(grant numbers:XDB32040000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015102","Convolutional neural networks (CNN);functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS);mild cognitive impairment (MCI);multi-dimensional feature evaluation;multilayer perceptron (MLP)","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Fans","","10","","48","CCBYNCND","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The task's objective is to correctly identify and categorize several object categories in the HSI, such as the ground, flora, water, and buildings, based on their spectral characteristics beneficial for a variety of applications, including mapping minerals, analyzing vegetation, and mapping urban land use. The difficulty of learning new task-specific knowledge from a limited data sample that encourages less training has not been overcome by deep learning models. The capacity of current models to generalize to new tasks on small datasets is still lacking. By learning features that are transferable to facilitate adaptation to novel tasks on small samples, metareinforcement learning (Meta-RL) shows promise in overcoming such difficulties. We proposed a Meta-RL model that decouples task inference to improve metatraining and accelerate metalearning with small HSI labeled samples for efficient classification. The model employs a capsule network for effective cooperation between spectra and spatial bands. To minimize the temporal difference error, the Apex-X Deep Q network parameter update is used to metatrain our model.

This study investigated how to approach the spectral average using only very few noise recordings for each wind speed, leveraging supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. Three different prediction methods, based on mean and interpolation, principal component analysis (PCA), and nonnegative matrix factorization, in combination with four techniques for coefficient estimation as the wind varies, are tested. Prediction based on principal component analysis, combined with Gaussian process regression, outperforms other methods in all three case studies considered.

DMS yields measurements that are visualized as dispersion plots that contain traces, also known as alpha curves. Current methods used for analyzing DMS dispersion plots do not usually utilize the information stored in the continuity of these traces, which suggests that alternative approaches should be investigated. In this work, for the first time, dispersion plots were interpreted as a series of measurements evolving sequentially. Thus, it was hypothesized that time-series classification algorithms can be effective for classification and analysis of dispersion plots. An extensive dataset of 900 dispersion plots for five chemicals measured at five flow rates and two concentrations was collected. The data was used to analyze the classification performance of six algorithms. The highest classification accuracy of 88% was achieved by a Long-Short Term Memory neural network, which supports the hypothesis that interpreting DMS measurements as sequential data is beneficial and outperformed classification algorithms traditionally used for DMS-based VOC identification.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3453496","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:323498,323529,323530); Suomen Kulttuurirahasto(grant numbers:50221583); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10663406","Classification;differential mobility spectrometry;long-short term memory;machine learning;neural networks","Dispersion;Chemicals;Current measurement;Ions;Pollution measurement;Accuracy;Voltage measurement;Classification algorithms;Spectroscopy;Long short term memory;Machine learning;Neural networks;Organic compounds","","","","48","CCBY","2 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work presents an innovative method for the dimensional synthesis of spherical mechanisms, which is based on the use of CNNs. In the proposed method, the trajectory that must be followed by the coupler point of a spherical four-bar mechanism is converted into images so they can be used as inputs for the CNN. The CNN is trained through a database generated with already known spherical mechanisms that met constraints such as the Grashof criterion and transmission angle constraints, among others, since these ensured the mechanism would function properly. In addition, the kinematic study of the spherical mechanism is presented through relative angles, as this allows for the generation of databases and the extraction of kinematic parameters to label the input images used in CNN training. Once the CNN was trained, the neural network was capable of performing the dimensional synthesis of the mechanism. Moreover, it was tested with three different case studies, resulting in three distinct mechanisms. The obtained results were evaluated using the metr2ev function, which allows for the comparison of two trajectories and provides information on their similarity in both time and frequency. The best result obtained was a similarity of 0.9953, indicating that the trajectory generated by the mechanism is reliable concerning the required precision.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3544450","Mexican Consejo Nacional de Humanidades Ciencia y Tecnología through Facultad de Sistemas Biológicos e Innovación Tecnológica, Universidad Autónoma Benito Juárez de Oaxaca (FASBIT-UABJO); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10897958","Convolutional neural network;mechanism synthesis;spherical four-bar mechanism;kinematics","Convolutional neural networks;Vectors;Trajectory;Kinematics;Feature extraction;Hands;Information filters;Couplers;Genetic algorithms;Training","","","","24","CCBY","21 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to being portable, non-invasive, and safe, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has become one of the most widely used neuroimaging techniques. Current BCI research primarily focuses on improving the decoding performance. However, a key aspect of stroke rehabilitation lies in inducing stronger cortical activations in the damaged brain areas, thereby accelerating the recovery of brain functions. This study investigated the regulatory mechanism of the generation rate of speech imagery on neural activity and its impact on BCI decoding performance based on fNIRS. As the generation rate increased from 1 word/4 s to 1 word/2 s, and finally to 1 word/1 s, neural activity in speech-related brain regions steadily enhanced. Correspondingly, the accuracy of detecting speech imagery tasks increased from 83.83% to 85.39%, and ultimately showed a significant improvement, reaching 88.28%. Additionally, the differences in neural activities between the “yes” and “no” speech imagery tasks became more pronounced as the generation rate increased, leading to an improvement in classification performance from 62.81% to 65.78%, and ultimately to 67.50%. This study demonstrates that the neural activity level of most speech-related brain regions during speech imagery enhanced as the generation rate increased. Therefore, accelerating the generation rate of speech imagery induces stronger neural activity and more distinct response patterns between different tasks, which holds the potential to facilitate the development of a BCI feedback system with higher neuroplasticity induction and improved decoding performance.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2025.3552606","Construction Foundation of First Class Universities 219(grant numbers:01270021922201*035); Basic Scientific Research Foundation(grant numbers:02120022124005); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022B1515120056); Basic Research Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20220818101217037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10931033","Brain computer interface;generation rate of speech imagery;functional near-infrared spectroscopy","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Stroke (medical condition);Decoding;Neural activity;Accuracy;Motors;Speech enhancement;Neuroplasticity;Electroencephalography;Image restoration","Humans;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared;Male;Imagination;Female;Adult;Speech;Young Adult;Algorithms;Healthy Volunteers;Stroke Rehabilitation","","","46","CCBY","18 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The water molecules and aging products are polar, which affects the dielectric response characteristics of the insulation system. Currently, the dielectric response testing technology has realized non-destructive evaluation of the moisture content of transformer insulation. However, the changes in the dielectric response caused by aging products are easily concealed by the influence of moisture, which makes the diagnostic technology ineffective for use in the evaluation of the aging of the oil-paper system. In order to avoid drawback, a new method utilizing frequency domain dielectric spectroscopy (FDS) and the water balance characteristics of the oil-paper insulation is proposed in this paper to evaluate the aging state of oil-paper insulation. The aging of oil-paper insulation will affect the water balance between oil and paper. In this paper, the experimental studies have shown that the water distribution coefficient between oil and paper and the degree of polymerization (DP) of the insulating paper shows a significant linear relationship.

However, the complexity of urban areas and their surrounding structures makes it extremely difficult to capture correlations between features. This article proposes a novel multiscale attention feature fusion network, composed of hierarchical convolutional neural networks and transformer to enhance joint classification accuracy of hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. First, a multiscale fusion Swin transformer module is employed to eliminate information loss in feature propagation, which explores deep spatial–spectral features of HSI while extracting height information from LiDAR data. This structure combines the advantages of the Swin transformer, featuring a nonlocal receptive field fusion by progressively expanding the window's receptive field layer by layer while preserving the spatial features of the image. It also exhibits excellent robustness against spatial misalignment. For the dual branches of hyperspectral and LiDAR, a dual-source feature interactor is designed, which facilitates interaction between hyperspectral and LiDAR features by establishing a dynamic attention mechanism, which effectively captures correlated information between the two modalities and fuses it into a unified feature representation. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated using three standard datasets (Huston2013, Trento, and MUUFL) in the experiments. The classification results indicate that the proposed framework, by fully utilizing spatial context information and effectively integrating feature information, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art classification methods.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3524443","Key Research and Development Plan Project of Heilongjiang(grant numbers:JD2023SJ19); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province(grant numbers:LH2023F034); High-End Foreign Experts Introduction Program(grant numbers:G2022012010L); Key Research and Development Program Guidance Project of Heilongjiang(grant numbers:GZ20220123); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10818716","Hyperspectral image (HSI);interaction transformer;light detection and ranging (LiDAR);multisource data classification;three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN)","Feature extraction;Transformers;Laser radar;Data mining;Convolutional neural networks;Convolution;Hyperspectral imaging;Correlation;Computer vision;Training","","1","","46","CCBY","31 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent research on hyperscanning has revealed substantial inter-brain synchrony (IBS), but little is known about the link between IBS and mental workload. To study this link, we conducted an experiment consisting of button-pressing tasks of three different difficulty levels for the cooperation and competition modes with 56 participants aged 23.7± 3.8 years (mean±standard deviation). We attempted to observe IBS using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and galvanic skin response (GSR) to assess the activities of the human autonomic nervous system. We found that the IBS levels increased in a frequency band of 0.075–0.15 Hz, which was unrelated to the task repetition frequency in the cooperation mode according to the task difficulty level. Significant relative inter-brain synchrony (RIBS) increases were observed in three and 10 channels out of 15 for the hard tasks compared to the normal and easy tasks, respectively. We observed that the average GSR values increased with increasing task difficulty levels for the competition mode only. Thus, our results suggest that the IBS revealed by fNIRS and GSR is not related to the hemodynamic changes induced by mental workload, simple behavioral synchrony such as button-pressing timing, or autonomic nervous system activity. IBS is thus explicitly caused by social interactions such as cooperation.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3144168","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government through the Ministry of Science and Information Communication Technology (ICT) (Development of BCI-based brain and cognitive computing technology for recognizing user’s intentions using deep learning)(grant numbers:2017-0-00451); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684407","Inter-brain synchrony;prefrontal cortex;social interaction;wavelet transform coherence;fNIRS;GSR","Task analysis;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Presses;Synchronization;Physiology;Performance evaluation;Hemodynamics","Adult;Brain;Brain Mapping;Cooperative Behavior;Galvanic Skin Response;Humans;Interpersonal Relations;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared;Young Adult","10","","88","CCBY","18 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, an automated framework is presented that classifies the spectra in a CRISM hyperspectral image using supervised learning models, where the required training data is produced by augmenting the mineral spectra available in the MICA (Minerals Identified in CRISM Analysis) spectral library, that keeps the key absorption signatures in the mineral spectra intact while providing adequate variability.

The proposed framework is validated on a set of CRISM images captured from different locations on the Martian surface by using different types of supervised learning models, like random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. An uncertainty analysis of the different steps involved in the pre-processing pipeline is provided, as well as a comparison of performances with some of the previously used methods for this purpose, which shows this framework works comparably well with a mean accuracy of around 0.8.

This helps users reliably predict driving range and optimize the charging process, thereby extending battery life and ensuring safety during use. However, due to temperature, driving mode, and charge-dependent electrochemical nonlinear dynamics, SoC estimation for LiB integrated with EVs remains a significant technical challenge. In particular, SoC estimation in the regions of SoC < 30% and SoC > 80% is often inaccurate due to nonlinearity and sensitivity to battery aging. Accurate estimation in these regions is crucial for making decisions regarding recharging and discharging to prolong battery life and prevent damage. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method for SoC estimation using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is capable of retaining information on battery characteristics related to changes long term electrochemical parameter changes, such as the number of discharge cycles and the aging effects. The method utilizes practical data from 80,000 samples collected from pure electric vehicle testing under different driving modes, temperatures, and road conditions over a 30-day period. The LSTM network was optimized by adjusting the input data sequence and hidden size to minimize the number of hyperparameters. This makes it suitable for use on low-cost processors with moderate computing power. SoC estimation was evaluated across four SoC test regions: SoC < 30%, SoC > 80%, 30% ≤ SoC ≤ 80%, and 0% ≤ SoC ≤ 100%. The results were compared with feedforward neural network (FNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Despite having a configuration with a hidden size of 96 and a single layer, the LSTM model achieved estimation accuracy with RMSE = 0.0106, MAE = 0.0077, and MAPE = 1.4116%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3493141","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) through Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:RS-2024-00454464); Thai Nguyen University of Technology (TNUT), Vietnam; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10746484","Lithium-ion battery;SoC estimation;long short-term memory network;electric vehicles;feedforward neural network;convolutional neural network","Batteries;Long short term memory;Electric vehicles;Accuracy;Aging;Temperature distribution;Estimation error;Discharges (electric);Data models;Battery charge measurement;Lithium-ion batteries;Feedforward neural networks;Convolutional neural networks","","","","23","CCBYNCND","7 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First of all, the unmixing performance and adaptive ability of the model are enhanced by introducing learnable parameters into the sparse unmixing algorithm. Then, a specific spatial convolution module is integrated into the network to promote the smoothness of the latent abundance map. Finally, a comprehensive loss function with three terms such as average spectral angle distance, hyperspectral images reconstruction error, and spectral information divergence, is presented to train the IVIU-Net in an unsupervised way. Compared to the unmixing results of most existing data-driven DL algorithms, our network has significant advantages in two folds: it is able to achieve better stability instead of relying heavily on the endmember initialization results and it has better interpretability and robustness in the unmixing procedure.

Firstly, anthracite and quartz sandstone were uniformly mixed according to 39 different ratios in this study, the samples' responses were obtained by terahertz system, and then the obtained time domain data was converted into frequency domain data by fast Fourier transform. The absorption coefficient spectrum and the refractive index profile of the 39 samples were calculated by optical parametric model.

Finally, we found that both two mathematical arithmetic is feasible to quantitatively detect different proportion of coal and rock mixtures.

Each CU processes a sub-part of the model and synchronizes results with others. Communication among these CUs has emerged as a key bottleneck in the training process. In this work, we present SiPAC, a Silicon Photonic Accelerated Compute cluster. SiPAC accelerates distributed DL training by means of two co-designed components: a photonic physical layer and a novel collective algorithm. The physical layer exploits embedded photonics to bring peta-scale I/O directly to the CUs of a DL optimized cluster and uses resonator-based optical wavelength selectivity to realize hardware multi-casting. The collective algorithm builds on the hardware multi-casting primitive. This combination expedites a variety of collective communications commonly employed in DL training and has the potential to drastically ease the communication bottlenecks. We demonstrate the feasibility of realizing the SiPAC architecture through 1) an optical testbed experiment where an array of comb laser wavelengths are shuffled by a cascaded ring switch, with each ring selecting and forwarding multiple wavelengths to increase the effective communication bandwidth and hence demonstrating the hardware multicasting primitive, and 2) a four-GPU testbed running a realistic DL workload that achieves 22% system-level performance improvement relative to a similarly-sized leaf-spine topology.

This severely degrades the perceived quality and intelligibility of enhanced speech produced by the AKF. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework that produces clean speech and noise LPC estimates with significantly less bias than previous methods, by avoiding the use of a whitening filter. The proposed framework, called DeepLPC, jointly estimates the clean speech and noise LPC power spectra. The estimated clean speech and noise LPC power spectra are passed through the inverse Fourier transform to form autocorrelation matrices, which are then solved by the Levinson-Durbin recursion to form the LPCs and prediction error variances of the speech and noise for the AKF. The performance of DeepLPC is evaluated on the NOIZEUS and DEMAND Voice Bank datasets using subjective AB listening tests, as well as seven different objective measures (CSIG, CBAK, COVL, PESQ, STOI, SegSNR, and SI-SDR). DeepLPC is compared to six existing deep learning-based methods. Compared to other deep learning approaches to clean speech LPC estimation, DeepLPC produces a lower spectral distortion (SD) level than existing methods, confirming that it exhibits less bias. DeepLPC also produced higher objective scores than any of the competing methods (with an improvement of 0.11 for CSIG, 0.15 for CBAK, 0.14 for COVL, 0.13 for PESQ, 2.66% for STOI, 1.11 dB for SegSNR, and 1.05 dB for SI-SDR over the next best method). The enhanced speech produced by DeepLPC was also the most preferred by 10 listeners. By producing less biased clean speech and noise LPC estimates, DeepLPC enables the AKF to produce enhanced speech at a higher quality and intelligibility.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3075209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9411829","Speech enhancement;Kalman filter;augmented Kalman filter;deep neural networks;temporal convolutional network;LPC","Speech enhancement;Noise measurement;Deep learning;Signal to noise ratio;Distortion;Kalman filters;Estimation","","13","","60","CCBY","23 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this, we basically build the multiple DNNs, which is responsible for each subband of the HB and the DNN ensemble is sequentially connected from lower to higher subbands. This sequential structure for the DNN ensemble carries out the denoising and HB regression to better estimate the HB energy levels. In addition, we use the voiced/unvoiced (V/UV) classification to differently apply the DNN ensemble depending on either V/UV sounds. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed BWE algorithm, we compare it with a speech production model-based BWE system and a DNN-based BWE system in which the log-power spectra in the HB are estimated directly.

Traditional methods mainly adopt bathymetric models and numerical optimization algorithms to deal with this problem. However, these methods usually tend to simplify the bathymetric models and lack the capability of describing the discrepancy between reference spectrum and estimation spectrum, resulting in a limited estimation performance. To get a more precise result, in this work, we propose a novel network based on deep learning to retrieve the IOPs. The proposed network, named as IOPs estimation network (IOPE-Net), explores a hybrid sequence structure to establish IOPs estimation module that acquires high-dimensional nonlinear features of water body spectrums for water IOPs estimation. Moreover, considering the insufficiency of labeled training samples, we design a spectrum reconstruction module combined with classical bathymetric model to train the proposed network in an unsupervised manner. Then, aiming at further promoting the estimation performance, a multicriterion loss is developed as the objective function of IOPE-Net. In particular, we construct a hierarchical multiscale sequence loss as the key component to retain the details of original spectral information. Thus, the discrepancy between different spectrums can be better described by the obtained learning model.

We utilized fNIRS measurements of HbO2 and HHb to estimate cortical activations and connectivity networks, which were then analyzed using power spectral density (PSD) and partial directed coherence (PDC). The findings revealed distinct patterns of cortical activation and connectivity for each task condition in both groups. Healthy individuals displayed lower cortical activations in the bilateral motor cortex (MC) during non-predictable obstacle avoidance, indicating efficient neural processing. On the other hand, pwMS exhibited lower cortical activations across most brain areas during non-predictable tasks, suggesting potential limitations in neural resource allocation. When tasks were combined, pwMS demonstrated higher cortical activation across all recorded brain areas compared to HC, indicating a compensatory mechanism to maintain gait stability. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that pwMS recruited higher bilateral somatosensory association cortex (SAC) than HC, whereas healthy individuals engaged more bilateral premotor cortices (PMC). These findings suggest alterations in sensorimotor integration and motor planning in pwMS. Four machine learning models (KNN, SVM, DT, and DA) achieved high classification accuracies (92-99%) in differentiating between task conditions within each group. These results highlight the potential of integrating fNIRS-based cortical activation and connectivity measures with machine learning as biomarkers for MS-related impairments in cognitive-motor interaction.

Therefore, registering MSI images is necessary for computer-based analysis of retinal degeneration via MSI.

The framework contains three parts: a template construction based on principal component analysis, a deformation field calculation, and a spatial transformation. The framework is uniquely capable of resolving two key challenges, i.e., the “multi-modal” characteristics in MSI images for the acquisition with different spectra and the requirement of joint registration of the sequential images.

Space division multiplexing (SDM) is a promising technology to overcome the looming fiber capacity crunch. Especially, few-mode multi-core fibers (FM-MCFs) can aggregate multiple cores into one fiber and two or more modes can be transmitted in one core, which can greatly increase the capacity yet introduce crosstalk constraints including inter- and intra-core crosstalk. To our best knowledge, there is no accurate crosstalk calculation model study in SDM optical networks with FM-MCFs. To address this issue, we first introduce the machine learning into the crosstalk prediction phase and propose a novel crosstalk estimation model (CEM) exploiting the beam propagation method called CEM-beam propagation method (BPM)-machine learning (ML), which can be used to evaluate the crosstalk during the design for the resource allocation scheme. Then, a crosstalk aware core, mode, and spectrum assignment (CA-CMSA) strategy is presented. The simulation results for crosstalk estimation at the wavelength level indicate that the crosstalk at lower frequencies is less than that at higher frequencies. Thus, the lower frequencies are always the first choice in the spectrum resource assignment phase. In addition, for our specific training set, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm based on machine learning performs better on the training, including regression values measurement and time consumption. The simulation results of the proposed CA-CMSA scheme also show that the resource allocation algorithm based on LM can improve resource utilization without increasing total connection set-up time.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to combine the benefits of both categories based on a compact representation of two feature vectors' outer product, which is called the multimodal compact multi-linear pooling technique. We first propose to expand the bilinear pooling technique for two inputs to a multi-linear technique to accommodate for multiple inputs (multiple inputs from multiple spectra are frequent in the multispectral biometric context). This fusion approach not only allows all elements to interact and enables multiplicative interaction, but also uses a small number of parameters and low computation complexity. Based on this fusion proposal, we subsequently propose a complete multispectral periocular recognition system. Employing higher order spectra features with an elliptical sampling approach proposed by Algashaam et al., our proposed system achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both our own and the IIIT multispectral periocular data sets. The proposed approach can also be extended to other biometric modalities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2731118","Scholarship of the Ministry of Education, Saudi Arabian Government 2014–2018; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990127","Periocular recognition;multispectral biometrics;feature-level fusion;higher order spectra;bilinear pooling","Iris recognition;Feature extraction;Face;Fingerprint recognition;Robustness","","18","","43","CCBY","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most algorithms in literature exploited dictionary learning schemes and deep learning architectures to capture latent fingerprints from complicated backgrounds and noise. However, an algorithm learned from other high-quality fingerprint images may not solve all possible cases within a given unseen image. We propose a new feedback framework to distinguish latent fingerprints from complex backgrounds and gradually improve friction-ridge quality using the information provided inside the given unseen image. We combine two efficient mechanisms. The first mechanism enhances high-quality areas in priority and feeds the enhanced areas back to improve the quality of latent fingerprints in the nearby area. The second mechanism is to verify that the first mechanism works correctly by detecting anomalously enhanced fingerprint patterns. The second mechanism employs a spectral autoencoder that learns from good fingerprint spectra in the frequency domain. The anomalous fingerprint area is sent back to the first mechanism for further improving the enhanced result. We benchmark the proposed algorithm against available state-of-the-art algorithms using two fingerprint matching systems (one commercial off-the-shelf and one open-source) on two public latent fingerprint databases.

However, they undergo complex nonlinear degradation and performance decline when abused, making their reliability crucial for effective electric vehicle performance. This survey paper presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art battery reliability assessments for electric vehicles. First, the operating principles of Li-ion batteries, their degradation patterns, and degradation models are briefly discussed. Subsequently, the reliability assessments of Li-ion batteries are detailed using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The qualitative approach encompasses failure modes mechanisms and effects analysis, X-ray computed tomography, and scanning electron microscopy. In contrast, quantitative approaches involve multiphysics modelling, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, incremental capacity and differential voltage analysis, machine learning, and transfer learning. Each technique is examined in terms of its principles, advantages, limitations, and applicability in Li-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Comparative analysis reveals that qualitative methods are primarily used in the early design stages to assess potential risks and in post-mortem battery analysis in the laboratory, whereas quantitative techniques such as machine learning and transfer learning offer real-time prognostic health management and anomaly prevention. Additionally, the quantitative techniques tend to be more cost-effective than their counterparts. The potential for consolidating reliability methods through standardization of testing protocols, real-world data integration, controller area network use, and policy regulation is highlighted to guide further research.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3406424","Carleton University; Texas Tech University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10540096","Capacity fade;causes of failure;data-driven;degradation trajectory;electric vehicle;electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;failure modes mechanisms and effects analysis;incremental capacity and differential voltage analysis;Li-ion batteries;machine learning;model-based;power fade;qualitative analysis;quantitative analysis;remaining useful life;reliability;state of health;state of charge;transfer learning;X-ray computed tomography","Lithium-ion batteries;Reliability;Degradation;Aging;Reviews;Computational modeling;Computed tomography;Voltage control;Machine learning;Quality assessment;X-ray tomography","","6","","196","CCBYNCND","28 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traditional linear unmixing model assumes that each mixed pixel can be represented by a linear combination of endmembers. Considering real-world situations, a sparse constraint is normally added to the linear unmixing model. However, the linear model does not take into account that the spectrum of mixed pixels is not simply linearly mixed. To fully study the mixing characteristics of ground object spectra before being imaged by the sensor, we propose a supervised unmixing architecture based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) by considering the spectral information and the sparse characteristics in the mixed pixel. Since 1-D CNN only considers feature learning, we combine the traditional root-mean-square error (RMSE) and ${\ell _{1}}$ regularization in its loss function to minimize training error. The performance of our proposed unmixing model is assessed by comparing the unmixing results with three traditional linear sparse unmixing algorithms and the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network in a simulated dataset and three real datasets. The RMSE was used to verify the unmixing accuracy of the different methods. The results showed that the RMSE obtained by our proposed CNN-based method was the lowest among the methods on all three real datasets, proving the effectiveness and stability of the CNN in unmixing tasks.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3126755","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071439,61871259); Opening Foundation of Qilian Mountain National Park Research Center(grant numbers:GKQ2019-01); Opening Foundation of Beijing Key Laboratory of Urban Spatial Information Engineering(grant numbers:20210209); Opening Foundation of Geomatics Technology and Application Key Laboratory of Qinghai Province(grant numbers:QHDX-2019-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609631","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);hyperspectral unmixing;spectral information","Hyperspectral imaging;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Neural networks;Training data;Geomagnetism;Decoding","","12","","48","CCBYNCND","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast, with the use of data-driven and sophisticated algorithms, modern hyperspectral technology can quickly deliver high-precision iron ore information, increasing efficiency. Magnetite collected from an iron ore mine in the Tangshan area is used as a pilot study, and its spectral data are used as the data source.

Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy is a preferred modality in vigilance detection due to the safe nature, the low cost and ease of implementation. fNIRS is not immune to motion artifact interference, and therefore human vigilance detection performance would be severely degraded when studied during locomotion. Properly treating and removing walking-induced motion artifacts from the contaminated signals is crucial to ensure accurate vigilance detection. This study compared the vigilance level detection during both stationary and walking states and confirmed that the performance of vigilance level detection during walking is significantly deteriorated (with a p<; 0.05).

The near-infrared image enables us to classify in the fields of agriculture, forestry, and geology/natural resources. However, the classification performances obtained from deep learning approaches using both red-green-blue (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) images were not significantly superior to the classification performances using the RGB image, because the spectral information may not be appropriately applied to the deep learning methods. In most deep learning approaches, the convolution operation does not separate the pixel values in the band direction, but rather mixes all the pixel values. This mixing can lead to the loss of information, particularly when dealing with multi-band images (like satellite imagery), as important spectral information might be obscured, affecting the model’s accuracy and generalization capability. To overcome the drawback, this study presents an efficient model, which is the separated-input-based U-Net (SiU-Net), via modifying the U-Net model based on the separation of RGB and NIR images. To show the performance improvement of land cover classification from the SiU-Net, the performance of SiU-Net was compared with those of the DeepLabV3+ and U-Net models. We utilized a 2020 satellite-derived land cover dataset, consisting of 300 patches in total. These patches were extracted from Sentinel-2 images, including both RGB and NIR bands, with a resolution of 10 meters, and each patch was sliced into  $512\times 512$  pixel segments. The entire set of 300 patches was selected without overlap, adhering to a distribution ratio of approximately 64% (192 patches) for training, 16% (48 patches) for validation, and 20% (60 patches) for testing. The final performance evaluations were ultimately conducted using the test data. The F1 score obtained from SiU-Net were about 0.797, and it was superior to about 0.541 from DeepLabV3+ and 0.720 from U-Net. Moreover, the F1 scores of SiU-Net (0.589) was more accurate than DeepLabV3+ (0.051) and U-Net (0.455) in the small training data, and the performance degradation due to data imbalance was reduced in the SiU-Net model. This means that the SiU-Net model may be most suitable when the training data are small and unbalanced.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3401416","1) the Institute of Civil Military Technology Cooperation, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy of Korea(grant numbers:22-CM-EO-02); 2)the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (MIST)(grant numbers:2023R1A2C1004395); Korea Institute of Marine Science & Technology (KIMST), backed by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries(grant numbers:RS-2023-00254717); Development of Optimization Techniques for Reducing Heat Wave Considering Urban Environment(grant numbers:2023-014(R)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10530973","Land cover;land cover classification;DeepLabV3+;separated input;SiU-Net;U-Net;red;green;and blue (RGB);near-infrared (NIR)","Land surface;Deep learning;Data models;Convolutional neural networks;Satellite images;Feature extraction;Training;Infrared spectra;Image segmentation;Image resolution;Meters","","4","","35","CCBYNCND","15 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Motivated by this, we investigate the MHANet for LPC estimation. We aim to produce clean speech and noise LPC parameters with the least bias to date.

DeepLPC is selected as it exhibits significantly less bias than other frameworks, by avoiding the use of whitening filters and post-processing. DeepLPC-MHANet is evaluated on the NOIZEUS corpus using subjective AB listening tests, as well as seven different objective measures (CSIG, CBAK, COVL, PESQ, STOI, SegSNR, and SI-SDR).

Despite existing radio regulations during the filing stage, this heightened congestion in the spectrum is likely to lead to instances of interference during real-time operations. This paper addresses the NGSO-to-GSO interference problem by proposing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models to detect interference events. In particular, we focus on the downlink interference case, where signals from low-Earth orbit satellites (LEOs) potentially impact the signals received at the GSO ground stations (GGSs). In addition to the widely used autoencoder-based models (AEs), we design, develop, and train two generative AI-based models (GenAI), which are a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a transformer-based interference detector (TrID). These models generate samples of the expected GSO signal, whose error with respect to the input signal is used to flag interference. Actual satellite positions, trajectories, and realistic system parameters are used to emulate the interference scenarios and validate the proposed models. Numerical evaluation reveals that the models exhibit higher accuracy for detecting interference in the time-domain signal representations compared to the frequency-domain representations. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that TrID significantly outperforms the other models as well as the traditional energy detector (ED) approach, showing an increase of up to 31.23% in interference detection accuracy, offering an innovative and efficient solution to a pressing challenge in satellite communications.","2831-316X","","10.1109/TMLCN.2024.3418933","Luxembourg National Research Fund(grant numbers:C21/IS/16193290); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10570488","Non-geostationary orbit satellites (NGSOs);geostationary orbit satellites (GSOs);interference detection;satellite communication;generative AI (GenAI)","Interference;Satellites;Satellite communications;Orbits;Low earth orbit satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Machine learning","","","","43","CCBY","25 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Amplitude histograms (AHs) are generated by processing the spectrums collected with different OSNR, launch power and transmission distance by an offline spectrum preprocessing flow. The MT-DNN can automatically learn the features of the AHs to achieve OSNR and nonlinear noise power estimation, simultaneously. For 4-quadrature amplitude modulation (4QAM), 16QAM and 64QAM signals under different transmission conditions, the average MAE and RMSE are calculated for the OSNR estimate and the nonlinear noise power estimate, which are both less than 1 dB. Moreover, the resistance of OSNR estimation to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise and nonlinearity, and the tolerance of nonlinear noise estimation to launch power and transmission distance are investigated, respectively. The results demonstrate that the joint OSNR and nonlinear noise power estimation scheme is insensitive to dispersion, transparent to modulation format, and has high accuracy and high tolerance.

Due to the small number of ground-measured samples, the hybrid method, using the radiative transfer model (RTM) to generate simulated samples and combining with the regression model, is popular for LAI estimation. However, there is still difference between simulated spectrum and measured spectrum, which may affect the inversion results. In this study, an iterative hybrid method combines BP neural network and PROSAIL model, and an optimal sample selection method for crop LAI estimation was proposed. A small number of ground-measured samples and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral data were used to estimate LAI firstly. Then, the initial LAI result was used as the parameter of PROSAIL model to generate the simulated spectrum. The simulated spectrum with high similarity with the UAV spectrum and corresponding LAI value would be treated as new samples for BP neural network. After several iterations, a reasonable sample set was obtained to estimate winter wheat LAI. The method proposed in this study is evaluated using ground-measured test samples and compared with the common hybrid methods. Results indicate that with the increase of the number of training samples, the accuracy of estimation model is improved (RMSE/MAE decreased from 0.4685/0.0301 to 0.4377/0.0272, respectively, while R$^{2}$ increased from 0.5857 to 0.6384). Also, the accuracy of proposed iterative hybrid model is higher than that of commonly used hybrid model. The experiments demonstrate the relatively high accuracy of the proposed iterative hybrid method, which could be used for vegetation parameter estimation with only a small number of ground samples.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3317499","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42030111); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:T2225019); Science and Technology Project of Guangzhou Construction Company LTD.(grant numbers:[2021]-KJ059); Guangdong Provincial Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Science and Technology Plan Project(grant numbers:2021-K1-140626); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10256196","BP neural network;hyperspectral UAV data;iterative hybrid method;leaf area index (LAI);PROSAIL","Estimation;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Crops;Hyperspectral imaging;Vegetation mapping;Iterative methods;Biological system modeling","","4","","53","CCBYNCND","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Amidst the growing interest in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for sensory analysis, our research distinguishes itself by employing a rigorous methodological framework. Our approach, named the ‘Incremental Analysis of Baseline Accuracy,’ identifies the chemical variables most predictive of wine quality. This framework aims to streamline the predictive process by pinpointing key variables that significantly influence quality assessments. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of a methodology that precisely determines the criticality of chemical inputs, both their exact values and their correct order, to identify which inputs significantly contribute to the quality assessment of a sensory perception, such as taste. The centerpiece of our paper is a vibrant 3D pie chart that illustrates the percentage criticality of different input variables for perceiving the quality of red wine. This chart symbolizes the essence of our paper: a ‘pie’ representing the empirical conclusion, not mere conjecture. Through this paper, we have shown that it is possible to quantify a qualitative, perceptual aspect like taste perception, which is often believed to be assessable only through subjective conjecture. Moreover, our findings, facilitated by the Incremental Analysis of the Baseline Accuracy method, demonstrate that this perception can be systematically quantified, challenging traditional assumptions about sensory analysis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3436603","Dean’s Office of the Allen E.

These dynamics can be investigated noninvasively in humans through a standardized active stand (AS) test, which involves continuous monitoring of blood pressure using digital artery photoplethysmography and frontal brain oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). While NIRS output is commonly assessed in terms of the tissue saturation index (TSI), it can also be quantified by the absolute concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb). This study aimed to explore functional clustering of systolic blood pressure (sBP) and frontal brain oxygenation during the AS test within the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA), comparing the health correlates of TSI and O2Hb clustered with the K-shape algorithm. A total of 2793 participants from TILDA wave three were included, with a mean age of 64.5 years and 46.9% being male. Both clustering methodologies revealed statistically significant associations with participants’ characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), pulse wave velocity, cardiovascular medication usage, and usual gait speed. Notably, the TSI_sBP clustering approach uniquely captured variations in the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) cognitive score and history of cardiovascular disease, whereas the O2Hb_sBP clustering method specifically identified variations in poststand orthostatic intolerance (OI) symptoms and future mortality. It was revealed that, when coupled with sBP signal, O2Hb information was associated with a clinically important longitudinal outcome, whereas TSI was not.

HDP based on federated learning can combine multi-party defect data to improve the defect prediction effect under the condition of protecting privacy. However, with the increase of task complexity and model performance requirements, the number of neural network layers gradually deepens, and the model parameters also increase accordingly. In a federated learning scenario with multiple model parameters, limited communication bandwidth, and multiple clients, the amount of data received by the server is very large, causing huge communication pressure and seriously affecting the overall training efficiency. In order to reduce the communication cost, this paper proposes a federated sparse compression (FSC) algorithm. First, in order to improve the generalization performance of the model, each participant performs local training based on CapsNet, and achieves better prediction performance by calculating the relative position information of feature combinations. Then the gradient parameters are encrypted based on differential privacy to ensure data security. In order to reduce the amount of communication bits, the encrypted model parameters are subjected to sparse binary compression, the model training is converted from dense calculation to sparse calculation, and Golomb encoding is selected to be sent to the server for aggregation. Finally, the server side decodes the received data, performs sparse binary compression and encoding and sends it back to each participant. Experiments on nine projects in three public databases (Relink, NASA, and AEEEM) show that FSC can effectively reduce the amount of communication bits.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3253765","High End Foreign Experts Introduction Program(grant numbers:G2022012010L); Reserved Leaders of Heilongjiang Provincial Leading Talent Echelon 2021; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061410","Federated learning;CapsNet;sparse binary compression;Golomb encoding","Software;Predictive models;Federated learning;Servers;Data models;Encoding;Computational modeling","","3","","36","CCBYNCND","6 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fortunately, if we focus on the phase information of backscattered light, it would be much easier to obtain the accurate vibration signal and separate different intrusions, due to the linear strain–phase response. Based on this technique, we present a vibration separation method by analyzing the time difference between two fiber positions in this paper.

However, when those parameters are unknown and additionally the materials show strong absorbances, a precise differentiation between materials is challenging. A promising approach is the use of a neural network for automated material classification of terahertz images from different materials. Here, we show that a trained neural network can differentiate between 16 3D printed dielectric materials with a high accuracy of 98 % from measurements taken in transmission mode. For unknown thicknesses, the accuracy is reduced to 35 %.

To predict the RUL, the line of research focuses on using the empirical degradation model followed by the particle filter (PF) algorithm, which is used for online updating the model's parameters. However, this works well for specific batteries under specific discharge conditions. When the degradation trends cannot be presented by the chosen empirical model or the standard PF encounters impoverishment and degeneracy problem, the RUL prediction would be inaccurate. To improve the RUL prediction accuracy, we propose a novel approach by enhancing the existing method from two aspects. First, we introduce a neural network (NN) to model battery degradation trends under various operation conditions. As NN's generalization and nonlinear representing ability, it outperforms the typical empirical degradation model. Second, the NN model's parameters are recursively updated by the bat-based particle filter. The bat algorithm is used to move the particles to the high likelihood regions, which optimizes the particle distribution and thus reduces the degeneracy and impoverishment of PF. In this paper, quantitative evaluation is presented using two datasets with different batteries under different aging conditions. The results indicate that the proposed the approach can achieve higher RUL prediction accuracy than conventional empirical model and standard PF.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2913163","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371041); Funding for Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation in NUAA(grant numbers:BCXJ14-04); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Funding of Jiangsu Innovation Program for Graduate Education(grant numbers:KYLX 0251); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8698866","Lithium-ion batteries;neural network;capacity degradation;remaining useful life prediction;bat algorithm;particle filter","Degradation;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Lithium-ion batteries;Neurons;Load modeling","","110","","39","OAPA","25 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between pilot operating behaviour and brain activity. Using a flight simulator (DA42) and noninvasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), changes in physiological signals were measured in 25 pilot cadets during different turning tasks. Twenty-five pilot cadets completed left and right turning tasks in a flight simulator, and the changes in blood oxygen concentration during different turning behaviours were analysed and modelled using machine learning models. Feature samples with significant differences ( $\text{p}< 0.05$ ) were extracted from the changes in oxyhaemoglobin concentration and selected for input into the SVM-linear classification model, the best results were achieved for the recognition of the pilot’s turning behaviour. After stratification based on feature importance, the SVM-RBF classification model obtained the highest accuracy (92.6%) after training with inputs containing a subset of features (60%) with the highest importance. In addition, the different turning behaviours of the pilots were closely related to activity in Brodmann area 17 (BA 17), BA 18 and BA 46.

In this paper, we propose a method to improve decoded signals using neural network-based side information. A neural network in the transmitter side that generates the side information and another neural network in the receiver side that estimates the log power spectra (LPS) of the original signal from the decoded signal and the side information are jointly trained to accurately reconstruct the original signal. In the same line with the analysis-by-synthesis, the neural network that generates the side information in the transmitter side takes not only the LPS of the original signal but also the LPS of the decoded signal as the input by decoding the encoded bitstream at the transmitter side.

Among various solutions for this purpose, hyperspectral imaging differs from its alternatives with its detection capability from standoff distances. However, the state-of-the-art for such a technology is still significantly missing a complete technical and experimental framework for surveillance applications. In this article, an end-to-end technical framework, which involves capturing, preprocessing, reflectance conversion, target detection, and performance evaluation stages, is proposed to reveal the potential of a ground-based hyperspectral image (HSI) surveillance system for the detection of explosive traces. The proposed framework utilizes a short-wave infrared region (0.9–1.7 μm), which covers the distinctive absorption characteristics of different explosives. Three classes of detection methods, namely index, signature, and learning-based methods are adapted to the proposed surveillance system. Their performances are compared over various experiments, which are specifically designed for granular and sprayed residues, fingerprint residues, and explosive traces on vehicles. The experiments reveal that the best method in terms of precision and recall performances is hybrid structure detector, which effectively combines signature-based detection with unmixing. While deep-learning-based methods have also achieved satisfactory precision values, their low recall values for the moment have comparatively limited their usage for the high-risk cases. Although one of the main reasons for the current performances of deep-learning methods is less data for learning, these performances for HSIs can be increased with more data in the future as in other image applications.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3299730","Havelsan Teknoloji Radar San. ve Tic.

Therefore, the processing of coal mine water source data is of great significance to prevent mine water inrush accidents. In this experiment, the water source data were obtained by laser induced fluorescence technology with the assistance of laser. The water sample data information was preprocessed by standard normal variable transformation (SNV) and multiple scattering correction (MSC), and then the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimension of the data and ensure the information characteristics of the original data unchanged. In order to identify the water inrush type of coal mine water source, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is used to optimize the BP neural network in this study. This is because the SSA algorithm has the advantages of strong optimization ability and fast convergence rate compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and other optimization algorithms. Experiments show that under the premise of SNV pretreatment, the R2 of SSA-BP model is infinitely close to 1, MRE is 0.0017, RMSE is 0.0001, the R2 of PSO-BP model is 0.9995, MRE is 0.0026, RMSE is 0.0019, the R2 of BP model is 0.9983, MRE is 0.0140, RMSE is 0.0075.

An integrated machine learning method of genetic algorithm and artificial neural networks (GA–ANN) was developed to retrieve the concentration of Chl-a. In situ spectra and simultaneous water quality parameters of 107 samples from two reservoirs (Res) and coastal waters (CW) were used to calibrate GA–ANN and three-band models (TBM) for comparison of Chl-a estimation. Both GA–ANN and TBM methods perform well for the joint dataset (WGD) of Res and CW with the R2 exceeding 0.90, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of corresponding validation (N = 35) are 4.40 and 5.23 μg/L, respectively. Similarly, for independent dataset of Res (N = 45), GA–ANN and TBM methods show robust performance: the R2 values are 0.87 and 0.80, respectively; and the corresponding RMSE values are 7.79 and 7.73 μg/L, respectively. For CW dataset (N = 62), the R2 values of two methods are 0.81 and 0.62, respectively; and the corresponding RMSE values are 0.79 and 1.32 μg/L, respectively. When the GA–ANN and TBM models were applied to retrieve Chl-a concentration from the calibrated Sentinel 2 MSI reflectance data in two Res on October 20, 2019, however, the validated results of MSI-derived Chl-a concentrations using quasi-synchronous in situ data (N = 36) indicated that the GA–ANN model outperforms TBM with higher R2 value (0.91 vs. 0.26) and smaller RMSE (4.41 vs. 13.85 μg/L) and mean absolute errors (3.40 vs. 11.87 μg/L) values. Although TBM has obvious overestimation of Chl-a concentration when applied to remote sensing image, we still thought that both GA–ANN and TBM are useful methods for Chl-a estimation in case-II waters, and GA–ANN performs marginally better with less deviation to measured Chl-a for multispectral remote sensing data. The ratio of TSS to Chl-a, experimental measurements, abundance of sampling points, and Chl-a concentration range are several important factors affecting the accuracy and robustness of GA–ANN and TBM methods.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3066697","Science and Technology Plan Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B030320002,2019A050506001,2018B030324002); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B030311059,2021A1515012579); Science and Technology Development(grant numbers:2018GDASCX-0101,2019GDASYL-0302001); Key Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory(grant numbers:GML2019ZD0301); Water Conservancy Science and Technology Innovation Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021-21); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9392233","Artificial neural networks (ANN);case-II waters;chlorophyll-a (Chl-a);coastal areas;genetic algorithm (GA);machine learning;Sentinel 2 MSI;three-band models (TBM)","Biological system modeling;Water quality;Reservoirs;Estimation;Water pollution;Genetic algorithms;Optical sensors","","30","","49","CCBYNCND","31 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, hyperspectral imaging-based oximetry techniques have been proposed for broad applications of two-dimensional information without sensor contact. However, these methods suffer from high computational complexity and inefficiency due to the large size of hyperspectral data cubes. In this study, we investigate an efficient tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) mapping from hyperspectral image using a generative adversarial network (GAN). The model was trained on hyperspectral images acquired from 40 healthy individuals. To reduce computational load while maintaining performance, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) was then employed to identify the optimal combination of hyperspectral bands. The selected optimal band combinations included both visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands. The GAN-based model with the ten-band combination estimated StO2 effectively, achieving a root mean squared error (RMSE) of  $0.1169~\pm ~0.0350$ . The trained model was then applied to palm and sole images of 20 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) to validate its performance. The performance on patient data was comparable to that obtained from healthy individuals, with the best results achieved using the ten-band combination (RMSE $= 0.1077~\pm ~0.0341$ ).

At the University of Michigan, we are developing a photon-based AI system that uses bremsstrahlung radiation from an electron linear accelerator (linac) as an ionizing source and trans-stilbene organic scintillating detectors for neutron detection. Stilbene scintillators are sensitive to fast neutrons and photons and have excellent pulse shape discrimination (PSD) capabilities. The traditional charge integration (CI) method commonly used for PSD analysis eliminates piled-up pulses and relies on a particle discrimination line to separate neutrons and photons. The presence of the intense photon flux during AI creates a significant number of piled-up events in the stilbene scintillator, thereby posing a great challenge to the traditional CI method. Identifying true single neutron pulses becomes challenging due to the presence of a pile-up cloud and overlapping neutron, photon and pile-up clouds in the PSD analysis. To mitigate the effect of pulse pile-up and identify true single neutron pulses from stilbene scintillators, an artificial neural network (ANN) system is developed. The developed ANN system identifies single neutron pulses and neutron-photon combinations from piled-up events. The results obtained from a 252Cf measurement in the presence of the intense photon flux show that the developed ANN system outperforms the traditional CI method. Since many piled-up events lie above the particle discrimination line, they get misclassified as neutrons by the traditional CI method resulting in 27% overestimation of the net neutron count rate during the linac pulse. The overall net neutron count rate (single and restored neutrons) during the linac pulse, estimated by the ANN system is 62.32% of the ground truth. Energy spectroscopy of the ANN attributed single neutron pulses further provides evidence on the detection of prompt fission neutrons from the 252Cf fission source.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3108406","U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, Academic Research Initiative(grant numbers:2016-DN-077-ARI106); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524625","Artificial neural network;high photon flux;linac;pile-up recovery;trans-stilbene","Neutrons;Artificial neural networks;Photonics;Detectors;Artificial intelligence;Scintillators;Gamma-rays","","12","","29","CCBY","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its relative success (still at a low single-digit percentile total market penetration) roots in the particular human-in-the-loop control, in which the trained surgeon is always kept responsible for the clinical outcome achieved by the robot-actuated invasive tools. Nowadays, this paradigm is challenged by the need for improved surgical performance, traceability, and safety reaching beyond the human capabilities. Partially due to the technical complexity and the financial burden, the adoption of telesurgical robotics has not reached its full potential, by far. Apart from the absolutely market-dominating da Vinci surgical system, there are already 60+ emerging RAMIS robot types, out of which 15 have already achieved some form of regulatory clearance. This article aims to connect the technological advancement with the principles of commercialization, particularly looking at engineering components that are under development and have the potential to bring significant advantages to the clinical practice. Current RAMIS robots often do not exceed the functionalities deriving from their mechatronics, due to the lack of data-driven assistance and smart human–machine collaboration. Computer assistance is gradually gaining more significance within emerging RAMIS systems.

It is a feasible and promising direction to solve the spectrum scarcity issue and has become a research focus in communication community. However, cognitive radio network is vulnerable to jamming attack, resulting in serious degradation of spectrum utilization. In this article, we view the anti-jamming task of cognitive radio as a Markov decision process and propose an intelligent anti-jamming scheme based on deep reinforcement learning. We aim to learn a policy for users to maximize their rate of successful transmission. Specifically, we design Double Deep Q Network (Double DQN) to model the confrontation between the cognitive radio network and the jammer. The Q network is implemented using Transformer encoder to effectively estimate action-values from raw spectrum data.

Many methods based on deep learning use deep and complex network structures to extract rich spectral and spatial features of hyperspectral images (HSIs) with high accuracy. During the process, how to accurately extract the features and information from pixel blocks in HSIs is important. All of the spectral features are treated equally in classification, and the input of the network often contains much useless pixel information, leading to a low classification result. To solve this problem, an enhanced spectral-spatial residual attention network (ESSRAN) is proposed for HSIC in this article. In the proposed network, the spectral-spatial attention network (SSAN), residual network (ResNet) and long-short term memory (LSTM) are combined to extract more discriminative spectral and spatial features. More specifically, SSAN is first applied to extract image features by using the spectral attention module to emphasize useful bands and suppress useless bands. The spatial attention module is used to emphasize pixels that have same category with the central pixel. Then, these obtained features are fed into an improved ResNet, which adopts LSTM to learn representative high-level semantic features of the spectral sequences, since the use of ResNet can prevent gradient disappearance and explosion. The proposed ESSRAN model is implemented on three commonly used HSI datasets and compared to some state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that ESSRAN effectively improves accuracy.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3197934","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A2013,62171417,62071438); Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction II(grant numbers:GASI-01-DLYG-WIND01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9854080","Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC);long-short term memory (LSTM);residual network (ResNet);spectral-spatial attention network (SSAN)","Feature extraction;Data mining;Training;Logic gates;Convolution;Three-dimensional displays;Semantics","","18","","64","CCBY","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper aims to model the activation pattern and the classification performances of the prefrontal hemodynamics regarding the movement-related events. Utilizing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) the changes in the concentration of the oxidized hemoglobin and deoxidized hemoglobin regarding voluntary and imagery movements are acquired. With necessary preprocessing, the fNIRS signals are statistically analyzed to localize the most significant activated regions regarding the applied stimuli. The experiment shows that movement-related events have a strong correlation with the prefrontal hemodynamics. The patterns of the movement-related hemodynamics are modeled by polynomial regression and used to classify the voluntary and imagery events based on the maximum similarity approach.

In recent years, convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to image reconstruction from speckles. However, the imaging spectra of these studies are mostly in the visible spectrum range and require complete speckle information for reconstruction. In this paper, researchers build an optical imaging system that employs up-conversion imaging technology to collect speckle patterns generated by infrared light transmitting through a multimode fiber and a frequency-doubling crystal. They propose a speckle restoration network (SRNet) based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct speckle images. The generator of GAN uses ResNest and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to extract multi-level features and multi-scale context information, respectively. The discriminator of GAN significantly improves the quality of the reconstructed image generated by the generator.

However, it is not practical to perform RPTs frequently because they are time-consuming and expensive; moreover, the Li-ion battery undergoes unnecessary degradation during test operations. Therefore, the RPTs should be performed as infrequently as possible. In this paper, a neural network-based SOH estimation scheme with reduced experimental data measured by the RPT is proposed for achieving economic efficiency and mitigating the dispensable degradation being caused by additional experiments. For the RPT-reduced experimental data, the continuous SOH estimation problem is formulated into a classification problem. The neural network learns how to estimate the SOH values using short time-series voltage and current data, labeled as the corresponding SOH values by the RPTs. Even in the SOH regions, where the data are not labeled as any given class and there is no prior knowledge on the corresponding SOH, the proposed SOH estimation scheme works well by performing regression with the class probability distribution.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932719","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2019R1A2C2008637); Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute; Korean Government(grant numbers:19ZR1150); Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism(grant numbers:1375026841); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8786090","Li-ion battery;neural network;reference performance test (RPT);state of health (SOH)","Estimation;Lithium-ion batteries;Neural networks;Degradation;Battery charge measurement;Mathematical model","","41","","27","CCBY","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A  ${k}$ -means clustering technique was applied to derive four recurring connectivity states. The states were characterized by both graph theory and semi-metric analysis. Occurrence probability and state transition were extracted as dynamic FC network features, and a Random Forest (RF) classifier was implemented to detect emotional sensitivity. The proposed method was trialled on 39 nursing students and 19 registered nurses during decision-making, where we assumed registered nurses have developed strategies to cope with emotional sensitivity. Emotional stimuli were selected from International Affective Digitized Sound System (IADS) database. Experiment results showed that registered nurses demonstrated single dominant connectivity state of task-relevance, while nursing students displayed in two states and had higher level of task-irrelevant state connectivity. The results also showed that students were more susceptive to emotional stimuli, and the derived dynamic FC features provided a stronger discriminating power than heart rate variability (accuracy of 81.65% vs 71.03%) as biomarkers of emotional sensitivity.

Consequently, battery-free energy harvesting represents a key aspect of sustainable development in smart agriculture. Plant microbial fuel cells (PMFCs) introduce a cutting-edge renewable energy source that scavenges energy from the symbiotic relationship between a plant and electron-generating bacteria in the soil, potentially supplying power as long as the plant lives. Characterizing PMFCs' power production is challenging, as it depends on many factors, such as soil impedance and plant condition. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is often used in laboratory tests, but it is inefficient to deploy in off-grid contexts. This article introduces an ultralow power EIS biosensor architecture that utilizes PMFCs as an energy source and for the EIS measure. We prove that ultralow-power EIS is compatible with PMFCs' mW-level power production through an implementation that integrates an EIS analog frontend and PMFC-tailored harvesting electronics. The architecture also facilitates PMFC unloading periods, crucial for PMFC recovery and durability. Experimental results show that a full-range EIS sweep (21.3 mHz–21.8 kHz, 19 points) executed with the proposed architecture requires only 3.64 J.

The ground-based 3-D remote-sensing stations were recently built to measure vertical distribution profiles of NO2. However, the stations were spatially sparse due to the high cost and could not make the measurements without sunlight. In this study, we first developed a multimodel fusion network (MF-net) based on the sparse vertical observations from the Jing-Jin-Ji region.

The MF-net significantly surpassed the conventional WRF-CHEM model and provided a more accurate evaluation of the NO2 transmission between Beijing and the neighboring cities. Besides, the MF-net covers the monitoring of NO2 to the whole study area and extends the monitoring time to the entire day (24 h), making it serviceable for continuous spatial-temporal estimation of NO2 and its transmission in pollution events.

This study explores an approach that generates consistent broad-band waveforms using past observation records, under the assumption that long-period waveforms can be obtained from physics-based simulations. Specifically, acceleration envelopes and Fourier amplitude spectra are transformed from long-period to short-period using machine learning methods, and they are combined to produce a broad-band waveform. To effectively obtain the relationship of high-dimensional envelopes from limited amount of data, we (1) formulate the problem as the conversion of probability distributions, which enables the introduction of a metric known as the Wasserstein distance, and (2) embed pairs of long-period and short-period envelopes into a common latent space to improve the consistency of the entire waveform. An experimental application to a past earthquake demonstrates that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to existing methods as well as neural network approaches. In particular, the proposed method reproduces global properties in the time domain, which confirms the effectiveness of the embedding approach as well as the advantage of the Wasserstein distance as a measure of dissimilarity of the envelopes. This method serves as a novel machine learning approach that maintains consistency both in the time-domain and frequency-domain properties of waveforms.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggab225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623770","Fourier analysis;Time-series analysis;Earthquake ground motions;Earthquake hazards","","","1","","","","22 Nov 2021","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In fact, multiple airborne and space-based instruments are actively used to estimate methane emissions. Many of these measurements are made using matched-filter-based detection and estimation algorithms. In this work, we present new methods for quantifying and improving the accuracy and uncertainty of these algorithms. Two new metrics are proposed that capture the biases and uncertainties in gas quantity measurements stemming from local surface and atmospheric variation, observation and solar geometries, and sensor noise. We show that one of these, termed the “sensitivity,” can be used to correct the bias in the gas concentration length estimates due to variable atmospheres and backgrounds, reducing the estimator’s root mean squared (rms) error in spectra that deviate from the mean spectrum. The second, termed the “uncertainty,” represents the bias-removed statistical uncertainty in the corrected estimator. Expressions for the rms error both with and without the correction are provided along with interpretation to help quantify the various noise sources. The utility of the metrics is demonstrated using data from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) imaging spectrometer currently collecting Earth observations onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The EMIT data also demonstrates the potential accuracy increase afforded by the sensitivity correction over variable surface types.

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) offer a promising solution by dynamically adjusting channel conditions to enhance wireless communication efficiency.

In the classification model, principal component analysis (PCA) is firstly used to reduce the dimensionality of this multimode sensing information from the SIMRR-based sensor. When the original higher-dimensional data points are projected onto the lower-dimensional data with only the first few principal components, they can be easily categorized into several different types by using density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm.

However, due to the heterogeneity of multi-source data, the model performance is usually not ideal. In addition, the project data holder is unwilling to disclose the data due to privacy regulations and other reasons, resulting in data islands. This paper presents a federal prototype learning based on prototype averaging (FPLPA), which combines federated learning (FL) with prototype learning for heterogeneous defect prediction. Firstly, the client used one-sided selection (OSS) algorithm to remove noise from local training data, and applied Chi-Squares Test algorithm to select the optimal subset of features. Secondly, the client constructed the convolution prototype network (CPN) to generate their own local prototypes. CPN are more robust to heterogeneous data than convolutional neural networks (CNN), while avoiding the deviation effect of class imbalances in software data. The prototype is used as the communication subject between the clients and the server. Because the local prototype is generated in an irreversible way, it can play a role of privacy protection in the communication process. Finally, the local CPN network is updated with the loss of local prototype and global prototype as regularization. We have verified on 10 projects in three public data sets (AEEEM, NASA and Relink), and the experimental results show that FPLPA is superior to other HDP solutions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3313001","Reserved Leaders of Heilongjiang Provincial Leading Talent Echelon of 2021; High and Foreign Expert’s Introduction Program(grant numbers:G2022012010L); Key Research and Development Program Guidance Project(grant numbers:GZ20220123); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10243025","Heterogeneous defect prediction;federated learning;prototype learning;data islands","Software;Prototypes;Data models;Predictive models;Training;Measurement;Training data;Heterogeneous networks","","2","","58","CCBYNCND","7 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these algorithms solely rely on data and image processing analysis to identify different kinds of water samples. To address this issue, we analyzed the fluorescence spectrum and the types of mine water inrush sources from the signal point of view. Firstly, a LIF water inrush spectral analysis system was built to collect spectral data and exhibit fluorescence spectra. Different methods of spectral signal decomposition and reconstruction were compared. The complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) algorithm with a better signal evaluation index was selected to preprocess raw spectral signals. Then, the multi-class support vector machine of the cuckoo search optimization (CS-MSVM) model was implemented to the reconstructed spectral signals in different stages. The classification accuracy of the reconstructed signals in the fifth stage was 100%. Compared with raw spectra, other signal processing methods, and other different classifiers, the proposed method has the highest classification accuracy. Finally, the reliability of the algorithm was validated by using the LIF spectral signals of different edible oils and the classification accuracy was 100%. The experimental results show that the CEEMD signal processing method combined with LIF spectroscopy is effective for the accurate identification of mine water inrush source, and it also provides a theoretical basis for the spectral analysis technology that can be used for the identification of other substances.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3000333","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFC0604503); Major Science and Technology Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:201903a07020013); Anhui Province Natural Science Foundation for Youths(grant numbers:1808085QE157); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9109324","Laser-induced fluorescence;signal processing;cuckoo search;mine water inrush","Water resources;Surges;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Fuel processing industries;Smoothing methods;Accidents","","7","","38","CCBY","5 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the social interactions assumed in existing dyadic hyperscanning studies do not sufficiently emulate polyadic social interactions in the real world. Therefore, we devised an experimental paradigm that incorporates the Korean folk board game “Yut-nori” to reproduce social interactions that emulate social activities in the real world. We recruited 72 participants aged 25.2 ± 3.9 years (mean ± standard deviation) and divided them into 24 triads to play Yut-nori, following the standard or modified rules. The participants either competed against an opponent (standard rule) or cooperated with an opponent (modified rule) to achieve a goal efficiently. Three different fNIRS devices were employed to record cortical hemodynamic activations in the prefrontal cortex both individually and simultaneously. Wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analyses were performed to assess prefrontal IBS within a frequency range of 0.05–0.2 Hz. Consequently, we observed that cooperative interactions increased prefrontal IBS across overall frequency bands of interest. In addition, we also found that different purposes for cooperation generated different spectral characteristics of IBS depending on the frequency bands. Moreover, IBS in the frontopolar cortex (FPC) reflected the influence of verbal interactions. The findings of our study suggest that future hyperscanning studies should consider polyadic social interactions to reveal the properties of IBS in real-world interactions.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3292844","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)](grant numbers:2017-0-00451); Development of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) based Brain and Cognitive Computing Technology for Recognizing User’s Intentions using Deep Learning; Brain Korea 21 (BK21) Four Project of the National Research Foundation of Korea; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10174679","Brain imaging;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;hyperscanning;inter-brain synchrony;triad","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Games;Standards;Task analysis;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Electroencephalography;Detectors","Humans;Cooperative Behavior;Brain Mapping;Irritable Bowel Syndrome;Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared;Interpersonal Relations;Prefrontal Cortex;Brain","4","","75","CCBY","6 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The experiment involved measuring 64 channels of EEG signals and 20 channels of fNIRS signals simultaneously during a task of the left-right hand MI. By combining these two types of signals, the study aimed to understand how feature fusion affected classification accuracy for MI. The EEG signals were filtered into three bands ( $\theta $ : 4–7 Hz,  $\alpha $ : 8–13 Hz,  $\beta $ : 14–30 Hz), while the fNIRS signals were filtered into 0.02-0.08 Hz to improve signal quality for subsequent analysis. The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm was utilized to extract features from both EEG and fNIRS signals. This allowed the researchers to create a fused signal with both EEG and fNIRS features that could then be processed using principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, the processed data was fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which improved the mean accuracy rate of MI to 92.25%. By comparing the classification accuracies obtained with fused and unfused segments of EEG and fNIRS signals, the study discovered that fusing the signals significantly improved classification accuracy by 5%-10%. Furthermore, analyzing the activated brain regions using fNIRS showed that the auxiliary motor cortex was significantly activated during MI. These results demonstrate that hybrid signals with a fusion strategy can enhance the stability and fault tolerance in BCI systems, making them valuable for practical applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3289709","Special Projects in Key Fields Supported by the Technology Development Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020ZDZX3018); Special Fund for Science and Technology of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020182); Wuyi University and Hong Kong & Macao Joint Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2019WGALH16); Startup Funds for Scientific Research of High-Level Talents of Wuyi University(grant numbers:2019AL020); Projects for International Scientific and Technological Cooperation(grant numbers:2023A050507068); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10163822","Motor imagery;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;common spatial pattern;principal components analysis;brain–computer interface","Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Covariance matrices;Task analysis;Electrodes;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","","8","","79","CCBY","26 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many mental stress detection studies have been focused on the discrimination of the mental state with and without the experimental stressor. However, the mental state in the absence of experimental stressors may not represent accurately the nonstress (baseline) state because people inherently experience considerable stress in their daily lives. Therefore, we assumed that stress detection could be improved more accurately by considering the daily stress. In this study, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was measured in 41 healthy participants to quantify their prefrontal cortical oxygenation during performing a cognitive task as an experimental stressor, considering individual daily stress level based on the self-report. We then extracted six signal features, including the slope, mean, standard deviation, peak, skewness, and kurtosis of the oxygenated hemoglobin concentration. Using various feature combinations and time windows, we successfully managed to classify daily stress (high/low) and the mental state (task/rest) with support vector machine classifiers. Specifically, individual daily stress level can be easily discriminated with signal features from fNIRS. Moreover, mental state classification performance improved significantly when the daily stress level was handled separately. The findings of this study show the feasibility of the fNIRS-based daily stress classification and can be used in the future to design a robust mental stress management system for the assessment of daily stress in individuals.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3035799","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant Funded by the Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1F1A1058011,NRF-2018R1A4A1025559); Sookmyung Women’s University Research(grant numbers:1-1803-1249); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247955","Daily stress;functional near-infrared spectroscopy;stroop word color task;mental stress classification","Stress;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Standards;Optical variables measurement;Indexes;Image color analysis","","10","","51","CCBY","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, many systems or networks of signal processing involve nonlinear functions, which could generate new frequency components beyond the original bandwidth and lead to aliasing. Indeed, aliasing-induced shift variance has long been a nuisance and unsolved problem in convolutional neural networks and has recently been found to severely impair the performance of machine learning applications. The same problem exists in other fields such as computational lithography. In this paper, a new method and algorithms are introduced to solve the problem of aliasing induced by nonlinear functions involving operations other than linear convolutions and pointwise multiplications. Said new method and algorithms employ implicitly defined functions that are implemented via iterations of polynomial operations so that aliasing is completely avoided by upsampling signals before polynomial operations and limiting signal spectra before downsampling. Theoretical analyses and exemplary algorithms are presented to implement nonlinear functions commonly used in signal processing networks. In particular, exemplary embodiments and numerical experiments are reported to illustrate and verify aliasing-free operations of Wiener-Padé approximants, which are already universal in their ability to approximate any continuous activation functions to the desired accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3192387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832878","Convolutional nonlinear networks;aliasing;translation invariance;shift-invariance;implicitly defined functions;iterative multiplications;spectrum control","Signal processing;Convolution;Convolutional neural networks;Nonlinear distortion;Image reconstruction;Bandwidth;Lithography","","2","","40","CCBYNCND","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the deep optical images of the Fornax Deep Survey, combined with public near-infrared data, we revisit the UCD population of the Fornax cluster and search for UCD candidates, for the first time, systematically out to the virial radius of the galaxy cluster. Our search is complete down to magnitude mg = 21 mag or M$_g\, \sim$ −10.5 mag at the distance of the Fornax cluster. The UCD candidates are identified and separated from foreground stars and background galaxies by their optical and near-infrared colours. This primarily utilizes the u−i/i−Ks diagram and a machine learning technique is employed to incorporate other colour combinations to reduce the number of contaminants. The newly identified candidates (44) in addition to the spectroscopically confirmed UCDs (61), increase the number of known Fornax UCD considerably (105). Almost all of the new UCD candidates are located outside the Fornax cluster core (360 kpc), where all of the known UCDs were found.

Hence, the programming of wireless beams with specific directions is emerging as a requirement for software-defined radio (SDR) platforms. To address this need, we introduce an affordable millimeter-wave (mmWave) testbed. Using a multi-threaded software architecture, the testbed allows for the convenient programming of mmWave beam directions using a high-level programming language, while also providing access to machine learning (ML) libraries as well as SDR methods traditionally deployed in Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices. To showcase the potential of the testbed, we tackle the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) detection problem using reinforcement learning (RL) methods on the receiver side.

This research primarily aims to present an advanced approach to classify different motor faults based on their time-series data by implementing a new Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model that consists of mixed Long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and two Fully Connected (FC) layers. The main idea of this study centers on developing one comprehensive model capable of categorizing primary motor faults. The proposed model is supposed to classify 10 different classes, extracted from the Machinery Fault Database (MaFaulDa), which are normal (no-fault), vertical misalignment, horizontal misalignment, imbalance, overhang-ball, overhang-cage, overhang-outer race, underhang-ball, underhang-outer race, and underhang-cage. Classifying 10 different situations can be considered as a notable classification problem. Additionally, the learning period did not include any data augmentation, which reflects the model’s power in training over the available data. Significantly, the accuracy of the model is enhanced by setting precise values for hyperparameters, including network structure (number of layers and neurons), learning rate, regularization, optimizer type, number of epochs, and more. The obtained train-validation-test accuracies from the proposed model are 99.87%, 99.599%, and 99.48%, respectively.

The network architecture utilizes permutation-invariant layers to predict a set representation, similar to the work performed in point cloud classification.

Observing that the existing hyperspectral gas detection methods in the thermal range neglect the fact that the captured radiance in the longwave infrared (LWIR) spectrum is better modeled as a mixture of the radiance of background and target gases, we propose a deep learning-based hyperspectral gas detection method in this article, which combines unmixing and classification. The proposed method first converts the radiance data to luminance-temperature data. Then, a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) and autoencoder-based network, which is specially designed for unmixing, is applied to the resulting data to acquire abundances and endmembers for each pixel. Finally, the detection is achieved by a three-layer fully connected network to detect the target gases at each pixel based on the extracted endmember spectra and abundance values. The superior performance of the proposed method with respect to the conventional hyperspectral gas detection methods using spectral angle mapper and adaptive cosine estimator is verified with LWIR hyperspectral images including methane and sulfur dioxide gases. In addition, the ablation study with respect to different combinations of the proposed structure including direct classification and unmixing methods has revealed the contribution of the proposed system.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3235781","The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(grant numbers:120E134); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10013725","Autoencoders;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);gas detection;hyperspectral unmixing","Hyperspectral imaging;Gases;Three-dimensional displays;Temperature distribution;Convolutional neural networks;Sulfur;Neural networks;Deep learning","","3","","37","CCBY","10 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, an improved capsule network is proposed and introduced into hyperspectral image target recognition. A convolution structure combining shallow features and multi-scale depth features is put forward to reduce the phenomena of ""different material, same spectra"" firstly, and then the diversity of the spatial structure is expressed by the capsule vector and sub-capsule division in channel wise, so that the averaging effect of the convolution process is weakened in the spectral domain and the spatial domain to reduce the phenomena of ""same material, different spectra"". By comparing the experimental results on the hyperspectral data sets such as Indian Pines, Salinas, Tea Tree and Xiongan, the capsule network shows strong spatial structure expression ability, flexible deep and shallow feature fusion ability in multi-scale, and its accuracy in target recognition is better than that of conventional convolutional neural networks, so it is suitable for the recognition of complex targets in hyperspectral images.","2075-5597","","10.1049/cje.2021.00.056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996115","Capsule network;Space-spectrum fusion;Hyperspectral;Classification;Deep learning","Hyperspectral imaging;Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Target recognition;Routing;Principal component analysis;Image classification","","1","","","","10 Jan 2023","","","CIE","CIE Journals"

The study shows that 1) driver’s EEG  $\delta $  and  $\beta $  wave PSD integral values are positively correlated with the thickness of sand on the road and the complexity of the road alignment; 2) drivers tend to change the speed to reduce the driving risk when there is no sand accumulation to 0-2mm and the flat straight road to the flat curved road, and drivers tend to change the driving direction to avoid the dangerous driving environment and reduce the driving risk when there is a combination of road sand thickness of 4-6mm and curved and sloped road; 3) spectrum of risky driving behavior characteristics is mainly distributed in the (0, 0.2] interval, and the risk of serious driving increases significantly in the  $\alpha $ / $\beta =0.81$  and  $\alpha $ / $\beta =0.89$  states, which account for 2.16 times and 5.28 times more than the  $\alpha $ / $\beta =1.01$  state, respectively.

Recently, different technologies were developed to determine bacteria susceptibility towards antibiotics; however, each of these technologies has its advantages and limitations in clinical applications. In this contribution, we aim to assess and automate the detection of bacterial susceptibilities towards three antibiotics; i.e. ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime and piperacillin using a combination of image processing and machine learning algorithms. Therein, microscopic images were collected from different E. coli strains, then the convolutional neural network U-Net was implemented to segment the areas showing bacteria. Subsequently, the encoder part of the trained U-Net was utilized as a feature extractor, and the U-Net bottleneck features were utilized to predict the antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli strains using a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). This one-class model was always trained on images of untreated controls of each bacterial strain while the image labels of treated bacteria were predicted as control or non-control images. If an image of treated bacteria is predicted as control, we assume that these bacteria resist this antibiotic. In contrast, the sensitive bacteria show different morphology of the control bacteria; therefore, images collected from these treated bacteria are expected to be classified as non-control. Our results showed 83% area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve when OCSVM models were built using the U-Net bottleneck features of control bacteria images only. Additionally, the mean sensitivities of these one-class models are 91.67% and 86.61% for cefotaxime and piperacillin; respectively. The mean sensitivity for the prediction of ciprofloxacin is only 59.72% as the bacteria morphology was not fully detected by the proposed method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3022829","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung through the Project Uro-MDD and the Center for Sepsis Control and Care (CSCC, Integrated Research and Treatment Center)(grant numbers:FKZ 03ZZ0444J,FKZ 01EO1502); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through the Core Facility Jena Biophotonic and Imaging Laboratory (JBIL)(grant numbers:BO4700/4-1); InfectoGnostics Research Campus(grant numbers:FKZ 13GW0096F); Leibniz ScienceCampus InfectoOptics; Strategic Networking of the Leibniz Association; Ministry for Economics, Sciences and Digital Society of Thuringia (TMWWDG) through the framework of the Landesprogramm ProDigital(grant numbers:DigLeben-5575/10-9); Freistaat Thüringen; European Union funds within the framework of the European Social Fund (ESF)(grant numbers:2019 FGR 0083); Open Access Fund of the Leibniz Association; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9187776","Antibiotic resistance;E coli strains;U-Net convolutional neural network;one-class SVM","Microorganisms;Antibiotics;Strain;Immune system;Microwave integrated circuits;Microscopy;Feature extraction","","6","","36","CCBYNCND","8 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, 11300 acquired in wave (WAV) mode are used to retrieve the wind directions using a spectrum-transformation approach and prior information from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis at version 5 (ERA-5) data at 1-h intervals with 0.25° grids. The dependence of the wind direction on the polarimetric correlation coefficient (PCC) between the co- (vertical-vertical and horizontal-horizontal) and cross-polarization [vertical-horizontal and horizontal-vertical] channels is studied. It is found that the PCCs in four combination polarizations have asymmetric characteristics with respect to the wind direction with correlation coefficients of greater than 0.4 or less than −0.4. Following this rationale, the scheme for inverting wind direction from quad-polarized SAR is trained according to machine learning, in which the matrix PCCs, wind directions, azimuthal angles, and slopes from SAR intensity spectra at the peaks are used as inputs. Subsequently, this intelligent approach is applied to 1300 images in quad-polarization stripmap mode, and the retrieval results are validated against advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) measurements. The statistical analysis shows that the root-mean- squared error (RMSE) of the wind direction is 17.7°, the COR is 0.98, and the scatter index is 0.11. In addition, the wind speeds inverted using a geophysical model function CSARMOD-GF are compared with well-calibrated ASCAT products, resulting in an RMSE of 1.85 m/s, a COR of 0.78, and an SI of 0.28 for the wind speed. Thus, this article provides an automatic scheme for inverting wind from quad-polarized GF-3 SAR images without any external information.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3332424","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42076238); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:23ZR1426900); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10319675","Gaofen-3 (GF-3);machine learning;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);wind direction","Wind;Wind speed;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar polarimetry;Sea surface;Surface waves;Satellites","","3","","57","CCBYNCND","16 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve this problem, we replace a low-rank speech model with a deep generative speech model, i.e., formulate a probabilistic model of noisy speech by integrating a deep speech model, a low-rank noise model, and a full-rank or rank-1 model of spatial characteristics of speech and noise. The deep speech model is trained from clean speech data in an unsupervised auto-encoding variational Bayesian manner. Given multichannel noisy speech spectra, the full-rank or rank-1 spatial covariance matrices and PSDs of speech and noise are estimated in an unsupervised maximum-likelihood manner. Experimental results showed that the full-rank version of the proposed method was significantly better than MNMF, ILRMA, and the rank-1 version.

In this paper, a target recognition method based on combined features with automatic coding and reconstruction is proposed to classify ship radiated noise signals. In the existing underwater acoustic target recognition systems, the target category features are mostly constructed based on the power spectrum according to a certain presupposed model, and some useful information in the data is discarded artificially. In the proposed recognition method, a feature extractor based on auto-encoding is designed. The feature extractor uses the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to automatically encode the combined data of the power spectrum and demodulation spectrum of ship radiated noise without supervision and extracts the deep data structure layer by layer to obtain the signal feature vector. The extracted feature vector is sent to a Back Propagation (BP) neural network to realize target recognition. Due to the high cost of ship radiated noise acquisition, the sample size of ship radiated noise signals is often hard to meet the needs of neural network training. A method of data augmentation is designed by RBM auto-encoder to construct the expanded sample set, which improves the performance of the recognition system.

Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) techniques serve as effective means to address this issue. In recent years, deep learning methods, particularly autoencoders (AEs), have been progressively employed in blind HU due to their compatibility with linear mixture models. However, most of the current advanced AE unmixing networks are based on a single-stage framework that conducts the unmixing task solely from a spectral perspective. This makes the rich spatial information ignored and makes it difficult for the network to obtain discriminative compression features while being susceptible to spectral variability and noise outliers. To address these issues, we propose a new deep shared fully connected autoencoder (DSFC-AE) unmixing network. The proposed DSFC-AE network comprises dual branches that utilize distinct data inputs for feature extraction: the original spectral data and coarse-scale spectral data obtained through superpixel segmentation. Furthermore, shared weight strategies are applied to the corresponding dimension reduction layers of the encoder, facilitating effective feature fusion. In addition, we integrate two constraint terms into the loss function, harnessing the sparsity of abundances and the geometric features of endmembers. We evaluate the DSFC-AE method against three traditional methods and four state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms using multiple real datasets. The results unequivocally demonstrate that the proposed network achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and stability.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3450856","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371430,62071439); Opening fund of the State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment Protection(grant numbers:SKLGP2022K016); Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science(grant numbers:OFSLRSS202207); Open Fund of Badong National Observation and Research Station of Geohazards(grant numbers:BNORSG-202302); Opening Fund of the Key Laboratory of National Geographic Census and Monitoring; Ministry of Natural Resources(grant numbers:2023NGCM11); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10654527","Autoencoder (AE);deep learning;hyperspectral unmixing (HU);superpixel segmentation","Feature extraction;Accuracy;Hyperspectral imaging;Estimation;Task analysis;Neural networks;Mixture models","","","","57","CCBYNCND","28 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, dual-modal fundus images include not only a regular color fundus image (RGB image) but also another two monochromic images acquired using two different wavelengths, 570 and 610 nm. The choice of these two wavelengths is based on the absorption spectra of hemoglobin. The two monochromic images provide much richer information on the arteriole and venule. Our proposed CRU-net can fully utilize the information and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on our dual-modal dataset (DualModal2019). The arteriovenous classification accuracy evaluated on the automatically detected vessels is 97.27%, significantly surpassed previous methods. The F1-scores are 77.69% and 79.53% for the arteriole and venule segmentation, respectively. We also test our CRU-net on the public DRIVE dataset with only the color fundus images.

However, relying solely on the use of convolutional neural network (CNN) or transformer approaches is insufficient for effectively capturing both global and fine-grained information, thereby compromising the accuracy of unmixing tasks. In order to fully harness the information contained within hyperspectral images, this article explores a dual-stream collaborative network, referred to as TCCU-Net. It end-to-end learns information in four dimensions: spectral, spatial, global, and local, to achieve more effective unmixing. The network comprises two core encoders: one is a transformer encoder, which includes squeeze-launch modules, DSSCR–vision transformer modules, and stripe pooling modules, while the other one is a CNN encoder, which is composed of two-dimensional (2-D) pyramid convolutions and 3-D pyramid convolutions. By fusing the outputs of these two encoders, the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder is bridged, resulting in improved feature mapping and unmixing outcomes. This article extensively evaluates TCCU-Net and seven hyperspectral unmixing methods on four datasets (Samson, Apex, Jasper Ridge, and Synthetic dataset). The experimental results firmly demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses others in terms of accuracy, holding the potential to effectively address hyperspectral unmixing tasks.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3352073","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62065003); Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Projects(grant numbers:ZK [2022] Key-020,General-105); Renjihe of Guizhou University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10387571","CNN;global and local information;hyperspectral image unmixing (HSU);spectral and spatial information;transformer","Transformers;Hyperspectral imaging;Convolutional neural networks;Three-dimensional displays","","6","","42","CCBYNCND","10 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spectral unmixing has been used widely for mixed pixel analysis. However, up to now, most spectral unmixing methods require endmembers and cannot consider fully intraclass spectral variation. The recently proposed spatiotemporal spectral unmixing (STSU) method copes with the aforementioned problems through exploitation of the available temporal information. However, this method requires coarse-to-fine spatial image pairs both before and after the prediction time and is, thus, not suitable for important real-time applications (i.e., where the fine spatial resolution data after the prediction time are unknown). In this article, we proposed a real-time STSU (RSTSU) method for real-time monitoring. RSTSU requires only a single coarse-to-fine spatial resolution image pair before, and temporally closest to, the prediction time, coupled with the coarse image at the prediction time, to extract samples automatically to train a learning model. By fully incorporating the multiscale spatiotemporal information, the RSTSU method inherits the key advantages of STSU; it does not need endmembers and can account for intraclass spectral variation. More importantly, RSTSU is suitable for real-time analysis and, thus, facilitates the timely monitoring of land cover changes. The effectiveness of the method was validated by experiments on four Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. RSTSU utilizes and enriches the theory underpinning the advanced STSU method and enhances greatly the applicability of spectral unmixing for time-series data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3108540","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971297,42171345); Tongji University(grant numbers:02502350047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9527866","Machine learning;real time;spatiotemporal spectral unmixing (STSU);spectral unmixing","MODIS;Real-time systems;Training;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Earth;Artificial satellites","","6","","52","CCBY","2 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in this article, we examine an LSTM based temporal spectrum prediction model and characterize its prediction performance through theoretical analysis. To this end, we analyze the LSTM prediction outputs over simulated Markov-model-based spectrum data and spectrum measurements data.

Previous methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) for predicting HRTF magnitude spectra from pinna images used HRTF log-magnitude as the network output during the training stage. However, HRTFs encompass the acoustical characteristics of the head and torso, making it challenging to reconstruct the spectral cues necessary for elevation localization. To tackle this issue, we propose PRTFNet to reconstruct the individual spectral cues in HRTFs by mitigating the influence of the head and torso. PRTFNet consists of an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) model and leverages a compact pinna-related transfer function (PRTF) that eliminates the impact of sound reflections from the head and torso in the head-related impulse response (HRIR) as network output. Additionally, we introduce HRTF phase personalization, a technique that utilizes the phase spectra of a selected HRTFs from a database and adjusts the phase by multiplying it by the ratio of the target listener’s head width to that of the subject of the selected HRTFs. We evaluated the proposed HRTF individualization methods using the HUTUBS dataset, and the results demonstrate that PRTFNet is highly effective in reconstructing the first and second spectral cues. In terms of log spectral distortion (LSD) and effective LSD (LSDE), PRTFNet outperforms previous deep learning-based model. Furthermore, multiplying the selected phase by the head width ratio reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of interaural time difference (ITD) by 0.003 ms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3308143","BK21 FOUR Program of the National Research Foundation Korea (NRF); Ministry of Education (MOE); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10229140","Head-related transfer functions;individualization;pinna-related transfer functions;spectral cues;spatial hearing","Location awareness;Head;Torso;Spatial audio;Transfer functions;Acoustic measurements;Image reconstruction;Spatial audio;Rendering (computer graphics);Root mean square","","1","","62","CCBYNCND","24 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the battery is a bottleneck restricting EVs from being utilized in the same way as petroleum-fueled vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) are commonly used in EVs, but have an optimal temperature range, and operation outside this range causes accelerated aging in the form of capacity fading and power fading, especially in cold climates. We propose that both state parameter estimation and thermal management are interconnected problems and should be addressed together: Battery health and performance depends on temperature, while temperature depends on operational conditions, battery health, structural design and thermal management. Temperature dependent decay accounting for heat generation in cells, temperature variation between cells and heat transfer with surroundings, can allow more accurate state parameter estimation and guide thermal management strategies. This review investigates how the dynamics of temperature dependence and heat generation are addressed in the literature related to estimation of battery state parameters. Approaches involving temperature were divided into three categories: 1) maintain constant ambient temperature and omit battery temperature, 2) verify at different ambient temperatures, and 3) use available data for cell and/or ambient temperature. A valid solution to the problem in real applications, must satisfy three criteria: a) suitable for online applications, b) scalable to battery packs, and c) applicable to dynamic battery cycling occurring during normal use.

We prove that the spectrum prediction output follows normal distribution through distribution fitting test, and formulate the problem of robust spectrum prediction in the presence of sensing errors as a binary hypothesis testing. On the basis of these, we develop MBR-RSP, in which the optimal threshold is proved to minimize the Bayesian risk of threshold detection. The experimental results both on simulated data and measured data show that the prediction accuracy of MBR-RSP outperforms that of neural network-based spectrum prediction in the presence of sensing errors.

The controller is designed to suppress the vibration of the flexible beams with different frequencies and reducing the contour error. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is adopted to obtain the mode shapes and natural frequencies of the flexible beam with clamped and endpoint mass boundary conditions. Analysis shows that the first-order vibration mode contributes the most to the displacement of the flexible beam. The trajectory motion profile based on time-shifted cosine jerk central angle interpolation (CJCI) contains prefilter to suppress low vibration frequencies in the two beams, which does not cause distortion of the actual contour.

This raises the possibility of an `optical biopsy' to aid clinical decision making. This approach faces barriers for being incorporated into clinical practice, including the lack of existing images for training, unfamiliarity of clinicians with the novel image domains and the uncertainty of trusting `black-box' machine learned image analysis, where the decision making remains inscrutable. In this paper, we propose a new method to transform images from novel photonics techniques (e.g. autofluorescence microscopy) into already established domains such as Hematoxilyn-Eosin (H-E) microscopy through virtual reconstruction and staining. We introduce three main innovations: 1) we propose a transformation method based on a Siamese structure that simultaneously learns the direct and inverse transformation ensuring domain back-transformation quality of the transformed data. 2) We also introduced an embedding loss term that ensures similarity not only at pixel level, but also at the image embedding description level. This drastically reduces the perception distortion trade-off problem existing in common domain transfer based on generative adversarial networks. These virtually stained images can serve as reference standard images for comparison with the already known H-E images. 3) We also incorporate an uncertainty margin concept that allows the network to measure its own confidence, and demonstrate that these reconstructed and virtually stained images can be used on previously-studied classification models of H-E images that have been computationally degraded and de-stained. The three proposed methods can be seamlessly incorporated on any existing architectures. We obtained balanced accuracies of 0.95 and negative predictive values of 1.00 over the reconstructed and virtually stained image-set on the detection of color-rectal tumoral tissue. This is of great importance as we reduce the need for extensive labeled datasets for training, which are normally not available on the early studies of a new imaging technology.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3060926","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:732111 (PICCOLO project)); Basque Government’s Industry Department through the ELKARTEK Program’s Project 3KIA(grant numbers:KK-2020/00049); Eusko Jaurlaritza(grant numbers:PRE_2019_2_0100,IT1229-19); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9359782","Histopathology analysis;convolutional neural network;domain adaptation;optical biopsy;virtual staining;Siamese semantic regression networks","Optical imaging;Biomedical optical imaging;Image reconstruction;Microscopy;Biopsy;Biological system modeling;Optical sensors","","12","","61","CCBY","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our group has developed a non-invasive Hgb measurement system using 10-second Smartphone videos of the index fingertips. Custom hardware sets were used to illuminate the fingers. We tested four lighting conditions with wavelengths in the near-infrared spectrum suggested by the absorption properties of two primary components of blood-oxygenated Hgb and plasma. We found a strong linear correlation between our measured and laboratory-measured Hgb levels in 167 patients with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 5%. In our initial analysis, critical tasks were performed manually. Now, using the same data, we have automated or modified all the steps. For all, male, and female subjects we found a MAPE of 6.43%, 5.34%, and 4.85 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.84, 0.5, and 0.49 respectively. The new analyses however, have suggested inexplicable inconsistencies in our results, which we attribute to laboratory measurement errors reflected in a non-normative distribution of Hgb levels in our studied patients, as well as excess noise in the specific signals we measured in the videos.

Firstly, MODTRAN is employed to obtain large numbers of AOP as original spectrum set in different weather and observation geometry conditions. Then the dimension of original spectrum is reduced by PCA. Next, a DNN is constructed and trained using compressed spectral signatures. Finally, estimated AOP are obtained through inverse PCA by decompressing the output of DNN. The results show that original AOP and estimated AOP have a high spectral similarity which relative error is less than 2%.

In this article, we propose an adaptive spatial-spectral transformer CD network based on spectral token guidance, named STCD-Former. Specifically, a spectral transformer with dual-branch first encodes the diverse spectral sequence in spectral-wise to generate a corresponding spectral token. And then, the spectral token is used as guidance to interact with the patch token to learn the change rules. More significantly, to optimize the learning of difference information, we design a difference amplification module to highlight discriminative features by adaptively integrating the difference information into the feature embedding. Finally, the binary CD result is obtained by multilayer perceptron.

It is based on NASA’s adaptive wavelength scanning LiDAR (AWSL) system. Rather than measuring 1-D line footprints over a satellite’s swath path as is the norm today, CS-LiDAR adopts sparse coded laser illumination over a 2-D wide field-of-view. The objective is to compressively sense Earth from hundreds of kilometers above Earth to then computationally reconstruct the 3-D imagery with resolution and coverage as if the data were collected from just hundreds of meters in height. The forward imaging model captures the light propagation phenomena affecting the photon pulses transmitted from the sensor to the Earth’s surface and back. This article advances CS-LiDAR on many fronts. First, imaging spectroscopy side information, often jointly available with LiDARs, is integrated into a multimodal imaging system. Second, the inverse imaging problem is cast under a transformer network architecture driven by multimodal attention mechanisms. Finally, by directing the snapshot spectral cameras in front of the LiDAR, the transformer mechanisms autonomously adjust the LiDAR’s beam scanning to focus on specific target locations, thus attaining end-to-end optimal adaptive sampling that can respond to varying observational conditions, surface events, and scientific priorities. Emulations enabled by enormous observational LiDAR data of Earth, available from NASA’s Goddard Lidar, Hyperspectral, Thermal (G-LiHT) imaging observatory, show the advantages attained by methods developed in this work.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3401614","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(grant numbers:80NSSC19M0087,80NSSC22K1099,80NSSC21K0964); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10535382","Hyperspectral;light detection and ranging (LiDAR);machine learning;side information;transformers","Laser radar;Photonics;Imaging;Satellites;Earth;Three-dimensional displays;NASA","","4","","26","CCBYNCND","21 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose CPGAN(Curve Clustering Architecture based on Projected Latent Vector of Generative Adversarial Network) for the clustering of curve dataset. Firstly, a novel GAN network structure, which utilizes a projector P (composed of the transposed convolutional network) to reconstruct the latent space of curve data, is proposed. CPGAN utilizes the concatenation of discrete code and Gaussian noise as a latent vector to preserve the implicit signal and structure of the cluster. Secondly, the loss function with two regularizations for CPGAN is proposed to guarantee the robustness and effectiveness of the model. Based on these, the jointly trained projector P is used to participate in the clustering process, while the generator can be used in the generating process.

In cross-spectral iris recognition, the illumination factor between NIR and VIS images significantly degrades the recognition performance. Therefore, the existing method only achieved recognition performance with an equal error rate (EER) larger than 5%, and it is a challenging issue for cross-spectral performance to have EER below 5%. In this paper, we improve iris recognition performance by concatenating the Gradientfaces-based normalization technique (GRF) to a standard (conventional) iris recognition method to alleviate the illumination effect. In addition, we integrate the GRF with a Gabor filter, a difference of Gaussian (DoG) filter, and texture descriptors, namely a binary statistical image feature (BSIF) and a local binary pattern (LBP).

However, due to its poor performance of recognizing selective attention tasks and inattention(rest)-state, the SSSEP-based BCI has not been widely used for practical interfaces. In this paper, we propose a mutual information-based spatio-spectral feature selection method for recognizing selective attention tasks and inattention(rest)-state using dry electrodes considering a real-life application, when vibration stimuli were applied to both index fingers. In our methods, the filter-bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) was used for extracting spatio-spectral features of the SSSEP. Then, discriminative features were selected using a mutual information-based best individual feature (MIBIF) algorithm. The regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) used as the classifier. The feasibility of the proposed method was demonstrated through eight healthy subjects using the vibration stimuli induced SSSEP with spatially clear and distinguishable patterns for SSSEP-based BCI. From our study, the proposed method showed the best classification accuracy with a kappa value of 0.35±0.17. Furthermore, based on the ANOVA with posthoc tests, the proposed method showed significantly higher accuracy as 57.9% in decoding three classes (p -value <; 0.01) compared to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and common spatial pattern (CSP)-based previous feature extraction methods. Consequently, the proposed FBCSP and MIBIF-based methods and findings can further help to improve decoding performance and develop the SSSEP-based BCI systems for real-world applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990384","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government (Development of Non-Invasive Integrated BCI SW Platform to Control Home Appliances and External Devices by User’s Thought via AR/VR Interface)(grant numbers:2017-0-00432); National Research Council of Science and Technology (NST); Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:CAP-18-01-KIST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9078739","Steady-state somatosensory evoked potential;selective attention;brain-computer interface;dry electrode","Feature extraction;Vibrations;Electrodes;Resonant frequency;Decoding;Indexes;Steady-state","","7","","33","CCBY","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its profound importance is evident, yet its adoption in medical imaging reveals a palpable gap. Historically, many networks rely on correlation for grouping spectral bands within the visible light spectrum. However, several medical case images are enriched with information in the near-infrared spectrum, mainly attributed to the near-infrared’s ability to penetrate the cellular surface, thereby accessing deeper layers of information. Therefore, grouping from a new perspective is very important. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Spatial-attention Transformer In Spectral-probability Transformer Network (TNT++), explicitly designed to enhance the spectral super-resolution of medical imagery. This methodology is tailored uniquely, drawing upon the inherent pixel statistical properties typical of medical hyperspectral images. Notably, by calculating the entropy value based on the pixel distribution of individual spectral bands, we unveiled the inherent joint spectral entropy patterns in the dataset, introducing an entropy-based grouping and revealing the nuances in image disorder levels—subtleties previously neglected. Our revamped transformer exhibits superior adaptability, proficiently capturing both the spatial and spectral complexities while adeptly navigating the intricacies of image architectures. Rigorous evaluations on the open-source Multidimensional Liver Cancer pathology dataset validate our model’s excellence. Outshining six contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques across four established metrics, it achieves a PSNR of 31.95dB and an SSIM of 0.9065, marking a significant stride forward in this discipline.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3336684","Haidian Transformation Special Fund of the Peking University Third Hospital(grant numbers:HDCXZHKC2022220); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10328746","Entropy;medical images;spectral super-resolution;transformer","Hyperspectral imaging;Transformers;Image reconstruction;Biomedical imaging;Microscopy;Superresolution;Entropy;Spectral analysis","","","","45","CCBYNCND","24 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the mechanism underlying cognitive activity involved during workstation design-related stress effects in the PFC has not been fully understood. We used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to simultaneously measure electrical activity and hemoglobin concentration changes in the PFC. The multimodal signal was collected from 23 healthy adult volunteers who completed the Montreal imaging stress task in ergonomic and non-ergonomic workstations. A supervised machine learning method based on temporally embedded canonical correlation analysis (tCCA) was utilized to obtain the association between neural activity and local changes in hemoglobin concentrations to enhance localization and accuracy. The results showed deactivation in alpha power rhythms and oxygenated hemoglobin, as well as declined activation pattern of the fused data in the right PFC at the non-ergonomic workstation. Additionally, all participants at the non-ergonomic workstation experienced a substantial rise in salivary alpha-amylase activity in comparison with the ergonomic workstation, indicating the existence of high-stress levels. The proposed tCCA approach obtains excellent results in discriminating workstation types achieving accuracies of 98.8% and a significant improvement of 8.0% (p <; 0.0001) and 9.4% (p <; 0.0001) over EEG-only and fNIRS-only, respectively.

A key component for obtaining efficient machine learning-based classification is the development of valuable knowledge-descriptive features. DASAR constructs a multi-level spectral representation by subdividing a signal into successive dyadic segments where each partition is modeled as an aggregation of single-frequency autoregressive processes. Thus, the model ensures a robust representation at the segment level, while the multi-level decomposition can capture time-varying spectra. As a feature extraction model, DASAR can provide useful learning features related to signals with complex spectra. The effectiveness of our model was tested on a dataset comprised of 11 different modulation techniques and realistic transmission medium characteristics.

The brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology capable of detecting mental states automatically by employing various brain sensing and machine learning methods. This contributes to efforts involving neurological disease management and restoration of cognitive function. In this study, we present an independent decision path fusion (IDPF) method by developing a bimodal asynchronous BCI based on electroencephalographs (EEGs) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to discriminate multiple mental states. The proposed IDPF method generates several independent decision paths, each of which is capable of analyzing cerebral information with respect to a specific aspect, thus interpreting the brain state from multiple points of view. Moreover, in one particular decision path for the fNIRS analysis of the IDPF method, we modified the EEG-based common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm according to the characteristics of fNIRS. The results show that the modified common spatial pattern (MCSP) significantly outperforms CSP in fNIRS-based BCIs. Through validation on an open-access EEG-fNIRS dataset and comparison with recent studies, we found that our IDPF method achieves a high accuracy of 70.32% for a four-class classification problem (left hand motor imagery, right hand motor imagery, mental arithmetic, and resting state).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953535","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFE0112000); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2017SHZDZX01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901130","Bimodal BCIs;mental states;EEG;fNIRS;machine learning","Electroencephalography;Signal processing algorithms;Sensors;Task analysis;Monitoring;Feature extraction;Electrooculography","","18","","59","CCBY","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study proposes a new method to identify spectrally similar materials from these types of imagery. The method is constructed based on the theory of condition number of matrix, and a theorem is proven as the foundation of the designed identification algorithm. Mathematically, the motivation behind designing this new algorithm is to decrease the condition number of the matrix for a linear system and, by doing so, to change an ill-conditioned system to a well-conditioned one. Technically, this new method achieves the purpose by adding supplementary features to all the original spectra including similar materials, which can be further used as indicative signatures to identify these materials. Thus, the proposed method is named a condition number-based method with supplementary features (SF-CNM). The threshold scheme and supplementary features are two main novelty techniques to ensure the uniqueness and accuracy of the proposed SF-CNM for specified samples. The results for a case study to identify water, ice, snow, shadow, and other materials from Landsat 8 OLI data indicate that SF-CNM can identify the materials specified by the given samples successfully and accurately and that SF-CNM significantly outperforms those of spectral angle mapper algorithm, Mahalanobis classifier, maximum likelihood, and artificial neural network, and produces the performance similar to, even slightly better than that of support vector machine.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3532816","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3902000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42272346); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province of China(grant numbers:2024NSFSC0083); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1624414); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10849635","Condition number;multispectral imagery;spectrally similar materials identification;supplementary features","Classification algorithms;Mathematical models;Landsat;Hyperspectral imaging;Training;Support vector machines;Reviews;Linear systems;Data models;Classification tree analysis","","","","36","CCBY","22 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the blur kernel characterizes the continual change of image blur extent with the imaging distance. The designed CNN learns from the degradation model and then copes with the distance dependent image restoration problem based on the learned mapping between the low and high-resolution image pairs. The designed two-stage comparative experiment shows that the proposed method significantly improved the quality of the THz images.

Finally, the real and artificial signals are combined to train stacked autoencoders (SAE) to detect mechanical health conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed WGAN-SAE method, two specially designed experiments are carried out and some traditional methods are adopted for comparison. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method can deal with imbalanced fault classification problem much more effectively. The improved performance is mainly due to the artificial fault signals generated from the WGAN to balance the dataset, where the signals that are lacking in training dataset are effectively augmented.

Nevertheless, food image analysis using multispectral imaging systems(MISs) has not been applied to oil reheating analysis despite their vast application in rapid food quality screening. To that end, the paper discusses the application of a low-cost MSI to estimate the ‘reheat cycle count classes’ (number of times an oil sample is recursively heated) and identify ‘critical classes’ at which substantial changes in the oil sample have materialized. Firstly, the reheat cycle count class is estimated with Bhattacharyya distance between the reheated and a pure oil sample as the input. The classification was performed using a support vector machine classifier that resulted in an accuracy of 83.34% for reheat cycle count identification. Subsequently, an unsupervised clustering procedure was introduced using a modified spectral clustering (SC) algorithm to distinguish critical classes under reheating. In addition, laboratory experiments were performed to ascertain the ramifications of the reheating process with a chemical analysis. The chemical analysis of the coconut oil samples used in the experiment coincided with the image analysis results and was statistically significant ( $p < 0.05$ ). Accordingly, the proposed work closes the gap for using multispectral imaging for oil reheating and proposes a novel algorithm for unsupervised detection of critical property changes in the oil. Hence, the proposed research work is significant in its practical implications, contribution to food image analysis, and unsupervised classification mechanisms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3144841","University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka(grant numbers:URG/2017/26/E); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686744","Multispectral imaging;oil reheating;transmittance spectrum;quality analysis;support vector machines;spectral clustering","Oils;Spectroscopy;Multispectral imaging;Imaging;Image analysis;Photography;Chemicals","","2","","88","CCBY","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Continuous development of satellite remote sensing and deep learning has made large-scale and wide-ranging ship detection (SD) possible, which is of great significance for ship safety. However, existing ship datasets used for deep learning only include ship images in open waters (OW), such as ports and inland rivers. Currently, remote sensing datasets suitable for SD in ice-infested waters (IIW) are lacking. SD in IIW is more difficult than SD in OW because of complex background interference from sea ice. Thus, it is infeasible to directly use the features of ships in OW for SD in IIW. Herein, we propose a remote sensing SD dataset called IceRegionShip, which includes subdatasets IceRegionShip–red, green and blue (RGB) and IceRegionShip–ice region ship index (IRSI). IceRegionShip–IRSI consists of low-resolution images processed with IRSI. IceRegionShip–RGB and IceRegionShip–IRSI contain 11 436 and 9073 ship instances, respectively. IRSI was proposed to address false alarms caused by ice interference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset designed specifically for SD in IIW.

In this paper, we propose to use a deep generative architecture, a deep neural network (DNN) generatively trained, as a postfilter. The network models the conditional probability of the spectrum of natural speech given that of synthetic speech to compensate for such gap between synthetic and natural speech. The proposed probabilistic postfilter is generatively trained by cascading two restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) or deep belief networks (DBNs) with one bidirectional associative memory (BAM).

Often, these mines are difficult to detect with metal detectors. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a promising technology for the detection of landmines with low metal content. Automatic landmine detection typically consists of two steps, namely preprocessing (or clutter removal) and classification. In this paper the clutter removal algorithm consists of a nonlinear frequency domain filter followed by principal component based filtering. Principal component analysis is performed in the frequency domain to build a background model for the clutter. The latter model is removed from the observed data in the log-frequency domain in order to preserve the phase component of the spectrum. Finally, the data is normalized and transformed to the time domain. The results presented in this paper show a marked improvement in the ability to remove general background clutter. Classification is performed on the basis of the prediction performance of neural network time-series models of the various classes of GPR responses. The classification system can correctly identify the position of metal anti-tank (AT) mines. It can also recognize specific examples of low metal AT and (anti-personnel) AP mines, but does have a low generalization ability for such mines.","1991-1696","","10.23919/SAIEE.2014.8531531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531531","Landmine detection;ground penetrating radar;neural networks;principal component analysis;clutter removal","Clutter;Ground penetrating radar;Landmine detection;Frequency-domain analysis;Data models;Antenna arrays;Metals","","3","","","","17 Dec 2018","","","SAIEE","SAIEE Journals"

Available methods mainly tackle this problem by modifying the land-based detection algorithms with classical bathymetric models, which usually fail to remove the interference of background and ignore the effect of depth information, leading to a poor detection performance. To achieve a more precise result, in this work we propose a novel network based on hyperspectral unmixing (HU) methodology and bathymetric models to detect the desired underwater targets. The proposed network, called underwater target detection network (UTD-Net), first develops a novel joint anomaly detector with classical HU methods to separate out target-water mixed pixels, which is devoted to eliminate the adverse influence of background. Then, we explore a bathymetric model-based autoencoder to unmix the target-water mixed pixels for acquiring the target-associated abundance values and maps. One dimension convolutional neural network is exploited to construct the encoder part of above autoencoder for the sake of addressing spectral variability problem. Moreover, considering the physical meaningless endmembers issue, a particular spectral constraint is imposed on the objective function as a training guidance. In this way, the autoencoder would be capable of generating specific endmembers and their corresponding abundance maps. Finally, according to the physical essence of abundance maps, we figure out the detection result by fusing the outcomes of autoencoder with weight coefficients determined by abundance values. Qualitative and quantitative illustrations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of UTD-Net in comparison with the state-of-the-art underwater target detection methods.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3080919","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971428,61671456,61806004,62001502); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020T130767); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9432747","Anomaly detection;bathymetric model-based (BMB) autoencoder;hyperspectral unmixing (HU);physical meaningless endmembers","Object detection;Hyperspectral imaging;Detectors;Computational modeling;Interference;Earth;Decoding","","24","","43","CCBY","17 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To further enhance WPT, the unique characteristics of metamaterial, such as its field focusing and evanescent wave amplification, have been successfully utilized. With subwavelength characteristics, computational challenges arise when the number of metamaterial unit cells is increased. In this work, we investigate a deep neural network (DNN)-based design of the tunable metamaterial for WPT. Using structures specifically designed for different tasks, the DNN predicts the frequency spectra and synthesizes the unit cell's design parameters. When trained using a set of ~23000 randomly selected designs, we achieve an accumulated mean square error (MSE) of less than 1.5× 10-3 for 97.3% of the 1929 test set. For synthesizing the unit cell's design parameters, the MSE is less than 2.5 × 10-3 for 95.7% of the test set. The data-driven method is further extended to a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create the WPT paths and predict the frequency spectra of them. To achieve high efficiency, we propose a cost function focusing on the spectra's transmission peak. After training using 80 000 measured data, the GAN can create WPT paths that efficiently connect the transmitter and the receiver on the metasurface. The results show that the DNN provides an alternative and efficient design method for the metamaterial, replacing traditional EM-simulation-based approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033527","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2018R1A2A2A05018621,2020M3H2A107678611); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239375","Wireless power transfer;tunable metamaterial;metasurface;field localization;deep neural network;generative adversarial network","Metamaterials;Resonant frequency;Task analysis;Switches;Neural networks;Wireless power transfer","","20","","43","CCBY","26 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, collecting these samples is challenging due to complex geological environments and inconvenient transportation conditions across large areas. To address this issue, a satellite sample simulation strategy was developed to transform ground-based local-area soil spectral samples into satellite-simulated spectral samples. Subsequently, a transfer learning (TL) approach was implemented to encode the spectra-SOM relationship learned from the satellite-simulated sample set into a basic neural network model. Finally, by fine-tuning this model with only a small number of satellite spectral samples, a robust SOM satellite mapping model was established. The results indicated that a total of 846 satellite-simulated spectral samples were generated, and the differences between the satellite-simulated spectral samples and the satellite spectral samples were minimized. The optimal TL-based SOM satellite mapping model (TL-half model) had an R2 of 0.90 and RPIQ of 4.02, representing a 12.50% improvement over the traditional SOM mapping model (R2 = 0.80; RPIQ = 3.10).

The endmembers of a hyperspectral image (HSI) are more likely to be generated by independent sources and be mixed in a macroscopic degree before arriving at the sensor element of the imaging spectrometer as mixed spectra. Over the past few decades, many attempts have focused on imposing auxiliary regularizes on the conventional nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) framework in order to effectively unmix these mixed spectra. As a promising step toward finding an optimum regularizer to extract endmembers, this article presents a novel blind HU algorithm, referred to as kurtosis-based smooth nonnegative matrix factorization (KbSNMF) which incorporates a novel regularizer based on the statistical independence of the probability density functions of endmember spectra. Imposing this regularizer on the conventional NMF framework promotes the extraction of independent endmembers while further enhancing the parts-based representation of data. Experiments conducted on diverse synthetic HSI datasets (with numerous numbers of endmembers, spectral bands, pixels, and noise levels) and three standard real HSI datasets demonstrate the validity of the proposed KbSNMF algorithm compared to several state-of-the-art NMF-based HU baselines. The proposed algorithm exhibits superior performance especially in terms of extracting endmember spectra from hyperspectral data; therefore, it could uplift the performance of recent deep learning HU methods which utilize the endmember spectra as supervisory input data for abundance extraction.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3126664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609564","Blind source separation;constrained;endmember independence;Gaussianity;hyperspectral unmixing (HU);kurtosis;nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF)","Matrix decomposition;Hyperspectral imaging;Data mining;Feature extraction;Approximation algorithms;Pragmatics;Blind source separation","","16","","76","CCBY","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Methods: This paper proposes a neural network-based pipeline to cluster three types of organ failure patients by incorporating embedding pre-train using an ontology graph of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. We employ an autoencoder-based deep clustering architecture jointly trained with a K-means loss, and a non-linear dimension reduction is performed to obtain patient clusters on the MIMIC-III dataset. Results: The clustering pipeline shows superior performance on a public-domain image dataset. On the MIMIC-III dataset, it discovers two distinct clusters that exhibit different comorbidity spectra which can be related to the severity of diseases. The proposed pipeline is compared with several other clustering models and shows superiority. Conclusion: Our proposed pipeline gives stable clusters, however, they do not correspond to the type of OF which indicates these OF share significant hidden characteristics in diagnosis.

In addition, generalized intensity-hue-saturation (GIHS) is adopted to combine the decomposition coefficients.

The MVAE method can achieve good source separation performance thanks to a convergence-guaranteed optimization algorithm and the idea of jointly performing multi-speaker separation and speaker identification. However, one drawback is the high computational cost of the optimization algorithm. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes using an auxiliary classifier VAE, an information-theoretic extension of the conditional VAE (CVAE), to train the generative model of the source spectrograms and using it to efficiently update the parameters of the source spectrogram models at each iteration of the source separation algorithm. We call the proposed algorithm “FastMVAE” (or fMVAE for short). Experimental evaluations revealed that the proposed fast algorithm can achieve high source separation performance in both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent scenarios while significantly reducing the computational time compared to the original MVAE method by more than 90% on both GPU and CPU. However, there is still room for improvement of about 3 dB compared to the original MVAE method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3045704","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:18J20059); JST CREST(grant numbers:JPMJCR19A3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9298772","Multichannel source separation;multichannel variational autoencoder (MVAE) method;FastMVAE algorithm;auxiliary classifier VAE","Source separation;Spectrogram;Decoding;Task analysis;Neural networks;Optimization;Computational modeling","","5","","59","CCBY","18 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the randomness and variety of the background signal, the existing methods fail to eliminate all kinds of noise at the same time, especially when the noise is nonlinear. In this work, we proposed a deep learning method adopting self-attention mechanism, which can effectively suppress different levels of harmonic interference and Gaussian noise simultaneously. Our method deals with the two-dimensional time-frequency spectrum acquired by short-time Fourier transform from the temporal signal, learning global features and local features between time and frequency domain through the network, to achieve the purpose of reducing background noise.

Existing fault diagnosis methods are limited in their ability to effectively and non-destructively evaluate corrosion due to constraints in size resolution and the lack of effective indicators for corrosion evolution in electronic packages. This study presents a non-destructive quantification method using regression models with scattering parameters, offering early detection and high diagnostic accuracy. We gathered a comprehensive database of scattering parameter patterns reflecting various levels of corrosion to enhance the reliability of fault detection and diagnosis in electronic devices. To evaluate the feasibility of scattering parameters for non-destructive and quantitative corrosion assessment in interconnects, we conducted a comparative study across ten categories of models: Basic Linear Regression, Regularized Linear Models, Advanced Linear Models, Bayesian Models, Robust Models, Kernel-based Models, Neighbor-based Models, Tree-based Models, Gradient Boosting Models, and Neural Networks. Despite testing various advanced models, the Basic Linear Regression model outperformed all of them, achieving a Mean Absolute Error as low as 0.214% (Evaluated corrosion range: 0 - 100%). This superior performance is attributed to the close and linear relationship between scattering parameters and the degree of corrosion, demonstrating that scattering parameters are effective indicators for corrosion. Additionally, integrating independent scattering parameter channels with a data augmentation method using interpolation further enhanced the diagnostic accuracy of the regression models.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3536287","University of Suwon; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10857321","Copper interconnects;corrosion;fault diagnosis;regression models;S-parameter","Corrosion;Scattering parameters;Integrated circuit interconnections;Gold;Artificial intelligence;Surface impedance;Substrates;Humidity;Electrodes;Electric potential","","","","42","CCBY","29 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the uSFGAN framework, several specific regularization losses are proposed to enable the source excitation generation part to output reasonable source excitation signals. Both objective and subjective experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed uSFGAN achieves comparable sound quality to HiFi-GAN in the speech reconstruction task and outperforms WORLD in the $\text{F}_{0}$ transformation task.

However, as the resolution of measurement at these frequencies captures the underlying microstructure of the tissue, we will investigate the validity limits of such effective material models over a wide frequency range (10 MHz - 200 GHz). Embedded in a parameterizable virtual workbench, we implemented a numerical homogenization method using a hierarchical multiscale approach to capture both the dispersive and tensorial electromagnetic properties of the tissue, and determined at which frequency this homogenized model deviated from a full-wave electromagnetic reference model within the framework of a Monte-Carlo analysis. Simulations were carried out using a generic hypodermal tissue that emulated the morphology of the microstructure. Results showed that the validity limit occurred at surprisingly low frequencies and thus contradicted the traditional usage of homogenized tissue models. The reasons for this are explained in detail and thus it is shown how both the lower “allowed” and upper “forbidden” frequency ranges can be used for frequency-selective classification/identification of specific material and structural properties employing a supervised machine-learning approach. Using the implemented classifier, we developed a method to identify specific frequency bands in the forbidden frequency range to optimize the reliability of material classification.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3045327","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), German Research Foundation(grant numbers:287022738); Project TRR 196 MARIE in the framework of project(grant numbers:Project M03); Open Access Publication Fund of the University of Duisburg-Essen; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9296221","Material classification;multiscale modelling;homogenization;mm-wave applications;machine learning","Analytical models;Microstructure;Skin;Numerical models;Frequency measurement;Computational modeling;Two dimensional displays","","2","","33","CCBYNCND","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The flagging of RFI is particularly challenging for the solar and space weather observations at low frequency, because the solar radio bursts can be brighter than the RFI, and may show similar temporal behaviour. In this work, we investigate RFI flagging methods for solar and space weather observations, including a strategy for AOLAGGER, and a novel method that makes use of a morphology convolution.

The resulting data from a THz time-domain system represents a 3-dimensional (3D) hyperspectral cube which contains several 2D images corresponding to different frequencies or bands. Due to a frequency-dependent non-zero THz beam waist, these 2D images are corrupted by blurring artifacts: a THz beam waist is wider on lower frequencies leading to more blurry corresponding 2D images. At higher frequencies, the beam waist is smaller resulting in sharper, but noisier images due to the decrease in the THz signal amplitude. The main focus of this work is the joint reduction of blur and noise from THz time-domain images. We propose two instances of a fast joint deblurring and denoising approach which is able to deal with THz time-domain images corrupted by different noise types and frequency-dependent blur. The experiments performed on synthetic and real THz time-domain images show that the proposed approach outperforms conventional 2D deblurring approaches and methods tailored to remote sensing hyperspectral images.

Understanding its dynamics is vital for agricultural monitoring and climate change response. The physically based method for retrieving FVC from remote sensing data has great potential due to the theoretical basis of the radiative transfer model (RTM). However, the method is limited when applied to satellite imagery due to its uncertainty in simulating canopy reflectance. This article proposes a method that combines three-dimensional (3-D) RTM and convolutional neural network based transfer learning (CNN–TL) to address the inconsistency between simulated and satellite reflectance, improving maize FVC retrieval accuracy. First, 3-D RTM was employed to generate canopy reflectance datasets of maize at various growth stages. Second, CNN–TL is used to eliminate the discrepancy between 3-D RTM simulated reflectance and satellite reflectance, and the retrieval accuracy of CNN–TL is compared with random forest regression (RF) and CNN. Finally, the feasibility of the method was validated using time-series of measured data from multiple samples covering different growth stages of maize from 2021 to 2023. The results showed that, when retrieving maize FVC on GF-1, HJ-2, and Sentinel-2, CNN–TL performed the best (RMSE = 0.117, 0.063, and 0.081) compared to RF (RMSE = 0.186, 0.226, and 0.184) and CNN (RMSE = 0.133, 0.117, and 0.098). The spatial distribution of FVC maps remains highly consistent across all three satellites, indicating the exceptional performance of CNN–TL. These results contribute to the development of physically based methods for FVC retrieval and serve as a reference for multisource satellite studies.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3450301","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42271333); Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province(grant numbers:YDZJ202201ZYTS484); National Civil Space Infrastructure Land Observation Satellites(grant numbers:2017-000052-73-01-001735); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2412022ZD027); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA28070500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10648810","Convolutional neural network (CNN);fractional vegetation cover (FVC);multispectral remote sensing;three-dimensional radiative transfer model (3-D RTM);transfer learning (TL)","Reflectivity;Satellites;Convolutional neural networks;Vegetation mapping;Crops;Accuracy;Three-dimensional displays;Climate change;Transfer learning;Remote sensing;Multispectral imaging","","","","74","CCBYNCND","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study validates the use of an uncertainty metric calculated directly from Chl $a$  estimates of the MDNs. We consider multispectral remote sensing reflectance spectra ( $R_{\text {rs}}$ ) for three satellite sensors commonly used in aquatic remote sensing, namely, the ocean and land colour instrument (OLCI), multispectral instrument (MSI), and operational land imager (OLI). First, a study on a labeled database of colocated in situ Chl $a$  and  $R_{\text {rs}}$  measurements clearly illustrates that the suggested uncertainty metric accurately captures the reduced confidence associated with test data, which is drawn for a different distribution than the training data. This change in distribution maybe due to: 1) random noise; 2) uncertainties in the atmospheric correction; and 3) novel (unseen) data. The experiments on the labeled in situ dataset show that the estimated uncertainty has a correlation with the expected predictive error and can be used as a bound on the predictive error for most samples. To illustrate the ability of the MDNs in generating consistent products from multiple sensors, per-pixel uncertainty maps for three near-coincident images of OLCI, MSI, and OLI are produced. The study also examines temporal trends in OLCI-derived Chl $a$  and the associated uncertainties at selected locations over a calendar year. Future work will include uncertainty estimation from MDNs with a multiparameter retrieval capability for hyperspectral and multispectral imagery.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3234465","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sensing (ROSES)(grant numbers:80NSSC20M0235); Phytoplankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem (PACE) Science and Applications Team; United States Geological Survey Landsat Science Team Award(grant numbers:140G0118C0011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10006833","Aquatic remote sensing;chlorophyll-a (Chl $\$ $  a $\$ $  );inland and coastal waters;Landsat-8;machine learning (ML);Sentinel-2;Sentinel-3;uncertainty","Uncertainty;Predictive models;Remote sensing;Data models;Biological system modeling;Measurement;Instruments","","6","","66","CCBY","5 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Difficulties include but are not limited to the poor UWA channels, impulsive noise, and data scarcity. To address these problems, a method based on hybrid neural networks (HNNs) is proposed in this paper. First, an impulsive noise preprocessor is adopted to mitigate the impulse in the received signals. Subsequently, an HNN consisting of an attention aided convolutional neural network (Att-CNN) and a sparse auto-encoder is built to extract features from the temporal waveforms and square spectra of the preprocessed signals after burst detection. Finally, a late fusion is made to combine the prediction results of the two sub-networks. To overcome the variable signal duration relative to the fixed input size of the Att-CNN, a data-reusing approach is proposed to perform dimension preprocessing on the waveforms. Moreover, a transfer learning strategy is introduced to resolve the issue of insufficient training data from the testing channel. The results of simulation experiments and practical signal tests both demonstrate that the proposed method is robust against UWA channels and ambient noise. Our approach significantly outperforms existing deep learning-based methods in dealing with short and weak signal bursts, while requiring less training data from the testing channel.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3046124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9300129","Automatic modulation classification;hybrid neural networks;attention aided convolutional neural networks;sparse auto-encoder;data-reusing;transfer learning","Testing;Feature extraction;Training data;Phase shift keying;Modulation;Frequency shift keying;Data models","","18","","44","CCBY","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The accurate capacity estimation of a battery is useful for detecting the degradation and end-of-life of the battery for scheduled maintenance and replacement, thereby improving the reliability of battery-powered systems. However, many of the capacity estimation methods developed thus far are offline methods and are not suitable for online monitoring. In this study, a novel capacity estimation method for Li-ion batteries is proposed, based on the enhanced coulomb counting (ECC) method. Typically, the battery capacity calculated by ECC has a large error owing to the error in the state of charge estimation. Therefore, additional means are required to obtain an accurate value for the battery capacity. The Kalman filter is an optimal estimator of the hidden state with Gaussian noise and is applied to the capacity values calculated by the ECC method. The performance of the proposed method in estimating capacity is verified through experiments with a Li-ion battery operated using a standard vehicle driving schedule. The results show that the online capacity estimation using the proposed method is performed successfully within 10 h with a 1.7% error.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3165639","National Research Foundation of the Republic of Korea “Research on the high speed multi-channel impedance spectroscopy technique for battery performance evaluation”(grant numbers:NRF-2021R1A2C1011504); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751147","Li-ion battery;enhanced coulomb counting;Kalman filter;capacity estimation;SOC estimation","Batteries;State of charge;Estimation;Error correction codes;Battery charge measurement;Voltage measurement;Kalman filters","","25","","34","CCBYNCND","7 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing fusion approaches for HSI and LiDAR suffer from limitations. Fusing the heterogeneous features of HSI and LiDAR proved to be challenging, leading to incomplete utilization of information for category representation. In addition, during the extraction of spatial features from HSI, the spectral and spatial information are often disjointed. It leads to the difficulty of fully exploiting the rich spectral information in hyperspectral data. To address these issues, we proposed a multimodal data fusion framework specifically designed for HSI and LiDAR fusion classification, called modality fusion vision transformer. We have designed a stackable modality fusion block as the core of our model. Specifically, these blocks mainly consist of multimodal cross-attention modules and spectral self-attention modules. The proposed novel multimodal cross-attention module for feature fusion addresses the issue of insufficient fusion of heterogeneous features from HSI and LiDAR for category representation. Compared to other cross-attention methods, it reduces the alignment requirements between modal feature spaces during cross-modal fusion. The spectral self-attention module can preserve spatial features while exploiting the rich spectral information and participating in the process of extracting spatial features from HSI. Ultimately, we achieve overall classification accuracies of 99.91%, 99.59%, and 96.98% on three benchmark datasets respectively, surpassing all state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of our model.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3415729","Hebei Normal University Commissioned Project(grant numbers:A2022070); Open Foundation of Yunnan Key Laboratory of Software Engineering(grant numbers:2023SE202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10574165","Cross-attention (CA);hyperspectral image (HSI);light detection and ranging (LiDAR);modality fusion;vision transformer (ViT)","Feature extraction;Laser radar;Transformers;Hyperspectral imaging;Data mining;Data models;Vectors","","19","","44","CCBYNCND","26 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper addresses the challenge of data scarcity in the development of methods for spatial super-resolution of hyperspectral images (HSI-SR). We show that state-of-the-art HSI-SR methods are severely bottlenecked by the small paired datasets that are publicly available, also leading to unreliable assessment of the architectural merits of the models. We propose to capitalize on the abundance of high resolution (HR) RGB images to develop a self-supervised pretraining approach that significantly improves the quality of HSI-SR models. In particular, we leverage advances in spectral reconstruction methods to create a vast dataset with high spatial resolution and plausible spectra from RGB images, to be used for pretraining HSI-SR methods.

The hyperspectral PRISMA images have a fine spectral resolution, however, their spatial resolution is not high enough to enable the discrimination of small plastic objects in the ocean. Pansharpening with the panchromatic data enhances their spatial resolution and makes their detection capabilities a technological challenge. This study exploits, for the first time, the potential of using satellite hyperspectral data in detecting small-sized marine plastic litter. Controlled experiments with plastic targets of various sizes constructed from several materials have been conducted. The required pre-processing steps have been defined and 13 pansharpening methods have been applied and evaluated for their ability to spectrally discriminate plastics from water. Among them, the PCA-based substitution efficiently separates plastic spectra from water without producing duplicate edges, or pixelation. Plastic targets with size equivalent to 8% of the original hyperspectral image pixel coverage are easily detected. The same targets can also be observed in the panchromatic image, however, they cannot be detected solely by the panchromatic information as they are confused with other appearances. Exploiting spectra derived from the pan-sharpened hyperspectral images, an index combining methodology has been developed, which enables the detection of plastic objects. Although spectra of plastic materials present similarities with water spectra, some spectral characteristics can be utilized for producing marine plastic litter indexes.

In this article, we first propose a hierarchical constrained energy minimum (HCEM) method to detect mislabeled samples (noisy labels) of original training set trained with supervised task and boost the performance of classifiers and spectral-spatial classification methods in HSI applications. The basic idea behind this work is that the filter output energy of noisy label spectrum is hierarchically suppressed based on the cascade of CEM detectors at different layers. The proposed HCEM method consists of four key steps: First, the distance information among samples is obtained to calculate the spectral similarity between samples per class in original training set. Then, the confidence spectra per class is constructed according to the maximum similarity domain. Next, the spectra of mislabeled samples is suppressed and the spectra of true samples is preserved by multilayers CEM detector. Finally, the noisy labels are detected and removed based on the output evaluated by the proposed HCEM method. Experimental results on four real hyperspectral datasets are verified by a series of spectral classifiers and spectral-spatial classification methods, it demonstrated that the proposed HCEM method, can accurately remove noisy labels of original training set and effectively improve the performance of supervised classification task.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2994162","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61977022,51704115); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019JJ50212); Key Research and Development Program of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019SK2102); Research Foundation of Education Bureau of Hunan Province(grant numbers:19B237); Hunan Institute of Science and Technology Innovation Foundation for Postgraduate(grant numbers:YCX2019A11); Engineering Research Center on 3-D Reconstruction and Intelligent Application Technology of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019-430602-73-03-006049); Hunan Emergency Communication Engineering Technology Research Center(grant numbers:2018TP2022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091876","Constrained energy minimum (CEM);hierarchical structure;hyperspectral image (HSI);noisy label;supervised task","Noise measurement;Training;Detectors;Hyperspectral imaging;Task analysis","","20","","54","CCBY","13 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mislabeling, re-branding, and false advertising are prevalent in this sector. Existing physical authentication techniques fail to adequately verify integrity of these products and protect the end-users. In this paper, we aim at addressing this critical problem through the development of a novel authentication solution. It builds on the chemical analysis properties of a powerful spectroscopy technique, namely, nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) that is quantitative, non-invasive, low-cost, and amenable for miniaturization (to hand-held form factors). The method is sensitive to small variations in the solid-state chemical structure of a sample, which change the NQR signal properties. These attributes can be unique for various manufacturers, enabling their use as manufacturer-specific watermarks. However, NQR spectroscopy only works reliably (i.e., provides good sensitivity) on compounds that contain certain nuclear isotopes. We take advantage of the intrinsic properties of NQR-sensitive isotopes to use them as extrinsic tags in NQR-insensitive products. The NQR spectra of these extrinsic tags act as unique watermarks that can be analyzed using machine learning methods to authenticate any consumable with high confidence. In particular, we use support vector machines to classify the measured spectra and confirm the identity of items under test. We have assessed this approach on a variety of consumables utilizing semi-custom equipment and verified that it results in high (>95%) classification accuracy. In order to prove the unclonability of such extrinsic tags, we have also performed a mathematical analysis that proves the randomness of the extrinsic tag and confirms its robustness to brute-force attacks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2893518","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:SHF-1563688,SHF-1563924); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8618411","NQR;authentication;classification;extrinsic tagging;consumables;supply chain","Authentication;Supply chains;Chemicals;Tagging;Resonant frequency;Spectroscopy;Sensitivity","","12","","29","OAPA","18 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The adaptation using the Domain Specific Units allows the learning of shallow feature detectors specific for each new image domain.

In this paper, we show the photon scattering signal strength can be magnified by introducing a more abrupt change of refractivity at the virus particle using antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), allowing the presence of such viruses to be detected. Using two different deep learning methods to minimize scattering noise, the photon states scattering signal of a AuNPs ligated virus is enhanced significantly compared to that of a bare virus particle.

Among the modalities, Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiography (ECG) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) were found to be the most used in assessing mental stress in the workplace. Nevertheless, these modalities are sensitive to motion artifacts and are difficult to be integrated into real work environments. To further improve stress level assessment in the workplace, multimodality integration with a reduced number of sensors such as EEG, GSR and Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can be utilized. This would lead to developing strategies for stress management in real-time. Furthermore, combining EEG with fNIRS would improve source localization of mental stress.

Generally speaking, small-scale spectral features can reveal local information within the spectral sequence, while large-scale ones capture global information across spectra. Recently, the proposed Transformer-based hyperspectral image classification (HIC) methods have shown superiority over convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in processing long spectral sequences but struggle with extracting local spectral details. Meanwhile, the multiscale information of the spectral dimension has not been fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a multiscale spatial–spectral Transformer named LSDnet. First, a bilateral filtering-based feature enhancement (BFFE) module is utilized to promote the reliability of shallow features. Then, a long- and short-distance spatial–spectral crossattention (LSDSC) module is proposed to capture both local and global HSI features. Moreover, a multiscale spectral embedding (MSSE) module is introduced to enrich local details among adjacent spectral bands. To enhance the model generalization, the spectral position bias (SPB) coding is designed in the Transformer encoder, adapting to variable spectral numbers of different HSIs. Furthermore, the traditional data partitioning strategy for HIC suffers from information leakage. Therefore, we propose a new data partitioning method to prevent the overlapping between the training and testing data. Meanwhile, an adjustment factor is utilized to balance the number of samples in each category, while a dynamic equilibrium loss (DEL) function is proposed to ensure the training contribution of every category. Experiments on three public datasets validate the rationality and effectiveness of our proposed HIC method.

However, a significant challenge in remote sensing of optically shallow water is to correct the effects of the water column. This challenge becomes particularly difficult due to the spatial and temporal variability of water optical properties. In order to model the light distribution for optically shallow water and retrieve the bottom reflectance, a parameterized model was proposed by introducing an important adjusted factor g. The synthetic data sets generated by HYDROLIGHT were utilized to train a neural network (NN) and then to derive the adjustable parameter values. The parameter g was found to vary with water depth, water optical properties, and bottom reflectance. Specifically, it revealed two obvious patterns among the different benthic habitat types. In coral reef, seagrass, and macrophyte habitats, g exhibited a remarkable peak at about 550 nm. The peak has a value of about 2.47-2.49. In white sand or hardpan habitats, g spectra are relatively flat. The semi-empirical model was applied to calculate the bottom reflectance from the new weighting factor, the downward diffuse attenuation coefficient, and the irradiance reflectance just below the sea surface collected in Sanya Bay in 2008 and 2009. Good agreement between the predicted and measured values demonstrated that the weighting factor g is an effective tool to modify the model for interpreting and predicting bottom reflectance without the need for any localized input (R2 > 0.79).","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2398898","U.S. Department of Commerce(grant numbers:BS123456); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2013CB956503); National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(grant numbers:41176161,U1405234); State Oceanic Administration South China Sea Branch Science and Technology Director Foundation(grant numbers:1338); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7047811","Coral reef;optically shallow water;seagrass;water column correction;Coral reef;optically shallow water;seagrass;water column correction","Attenuation;Optical attenuators;Adaptive optics;Mathematical model;Optical scattering;Optical sensors;Remote sensing","","5","","15","OAPA","24 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During this time, relevant operational parameters of the circuits, including circuit current, voltages across magnets and their coils, and current to ground, have been recorded. These data allow for a comprehensive analysis of the circuit characteristics, the interaction between their components, and their variation over time. Such insights are essential to understand the state of health of the circuits and to detect and react to hardware fatigue and degradation at an early stage. In this work, a systematic approach is presented to better understand the behavior of the main LHC dipole circuits following fast power aborts. Nonnegative matrix factorization is used to model the recorded frequency spectra as common subspectra by decomposing the recorded data as a linear combination of basis vectors, which are then related to hardware properties. The loss in reconstructing the recorded frequency spectra allows to distinguish between normal and abnormal magnet behavior. In the case of abnormal behavior, the analysis of the subspectra properties enables to infer possible hardware issues. Following this approach, five dipole magnets with abnormal behavior were identified, of which one was confirmed to be damaged. As three of the other four identified magnets share similar subspectra characteristics, they are also treated as potentially critical. These results are essential for preparing targeted magnet measurements and may lead to preventive replacements.","1558-2515","","10.1109/TASC.2024.3363725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10428027","Large Hadron Collider (LHC);machine learning;nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF);quench protection","Superconducting magnets;Magnetic circuits;Integrated circuit modeling;Large Hadron Collider;Machine learning;Anomaly detection;Magnetic variables measurement","","1","","43","CCBY","8 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, mining area types recognition methods encounter challenges such as low recognition accuracy and difficulty detecting small mining areas. To address these issues, this article proposes a stepwise top-down mining area types recognition framework. The framework consists of two steps. First, a GF-5 spectral index named the Normalized Difference Mining Area Index (NDMAI) is constructed to obtain the rough position of the mining area quickly. Then, the identification network of Mine Types with Transformer (Mitformer) is proposed for accurate type recognition of the candidate mining area regions. Mitformer combines a multiscale feature enhancement module and a decoder based on multilevel skip connections, which achieves a sufficient fusion of features at each layer of deep feature maps and adds the skip connections between low-level and high-level feature maps, thus, can improve the accuracy of types identification and the detection rate of small-scale mining areas. Moreover, this framework can effectively avoid misclassification caused by different objects with similar spectra to the maximum extent possible. This article selects two independent study areas with a large spatial extent, respectively, in Hebei Province and Anhui Province.

Satellite imagery and remote sensing techniques analyze the scene for the management of natural resources and environmental changes. Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) plays a vital role in land cover classification due to its rich spectral information, which captures a broader range of wavelengths. This enhanced spectral data allows for more precise identification and differentiation of land cover types. Imbalanced class distributions in HSI classification hinder rare class performance, as these critical classes are often underrepresented in training data. GANs offer a solution by generating synthetic samples to address this scarcity. However, current GAN-based methods use a static up-sampling mechanism for minority classes and generate samples for even larger classes. Furthermore, these models use the largest class as the scaling factor for minority classes, leading to excessive synthetic sample generation for smaller classes. Although these methods achieve class balance, but often suffer from synthetic bias due to over-reliance on generated samples, especially for minority classes. As a result, this can cause dataset inflation, compromise the authenticity of minority class representations, and potentially degrade the model’s performance on real-world data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel approach that dynamically balances class distributions by leveraging the smallest class size as a scaling factor. Our proposed model, Spectra Balance GAN (SB-GAN), ensures efficient and adaptive sample generation, producing only the necessary synthetic samples while preserving the integrity of the dataset and maintaining a manageable size. The primary novelty of this model lies in its adaptive nature of class balancing mechanism and an integrated conditional GAN to generate only the required samples, ensuring efficient and balanced hyperspectral image classification. The efficacy of the SB-GAN approach has been evaluated using three publicly available datasets: Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Salinas. The approach achieved an average classification accuracy of 99% across these datasets, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve the classification of rare classes in HSI scenes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3550057","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number (PNURSP2025R300), Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10918977","Hyperspectral imaging;HSI;GAN;cGAN;generative adversarial network;conditional generative adversarial network;down sampling;up sampling;synthetic;augmentation;imbalance class;land cover scene","Land surface;Accuracy;Hyperspectral imaging;Data models;Generative adversarial networks;Generators;Environmental monitoring;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Urban planning","","","","21","CCBYNCND","10 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to low spatial resolution and difficulty in obtaining HS images, spectral target detection based on it faces extremely serious problems of small-scale and mixed spectra. To address this problem, taking the more easily obtained high-spatial-resolution multispectral (HMS) image as an appropriate input, this article proposes a specific spectral target detection method through target-focused spectral super-resolution (SSR). Specifically, by taking the given target spectrum and the spectral library as priors, a target-focused SSR model under the sparse representation framework is proposed first, to enrich the spectral information of the HMS image, and to accurately reconstruct the corresponding high-spatial-resolution HS image, especially for the target area. Then, a target-specific band selection strategy is designed, to extract the most distinguishable spectral bands against background, which can enhance the separation between the target and background and help to reduce the false alarm rate of the detection. Finally, a background separation-based spectral target detection method for the selected bands is proposed, to locate the spectral targets directly by using the optimized target sparse coefficient matrix. Experimental results on four different datasets show that, our proposed method achieves the best target detection performance in comparison to other relative state-of-the-art methods, and can even efficiently handle the detection of subpixel-level spectral targets through this unmixing-like spectral dictionary expression.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3547347","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52272358,62103052,41971294,82471999); Beijing Institute of Technology Research Fund Program for Young Scholars of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10909183","Band selection;multispectral (MS) image;spectral super-resolution (SSR);spectral target detection;target focusing","Object detection;Dictionaries;Superresolution;Sparse approximation;Libraries;Image reconstruction;Spatial resolution;Detectors;Accuracy;Sparse matrices","","","","58","CCBYNCND","3 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we present a novel approach for signal classification using an OECT array, which exhibits multifunctional bioelectronic functionality similar to neurons and synapses linked through a global medium. Our approach takes advantage of the intrinsic device variabilities of OECTs to create a reservoir network with variable neuron-time constants and synaptic strengths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by classifying surface-electromyogram (s-EMG) signals into three hand gesture categories. The OECT array performs efficient signal acquisition by feeding signals through multiple gates and measuring the response to a group of OECTs with a global liquid medium. We compare the performance of our approach with and without projecting the input on OECTs and observe a significant increase in classification accuracy from 40% to 68%. We also examined how the classification performance is affected by different selection strategies and numbers of OECTs used. Finally, we developed a spiking neural network-based simulation that mimics the OECTs array and found that OECT-based classification is comparable to the spiking neural network-based approach.

The potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems to acquire high resolution images has opened new frontiers and led to its exploration in new applications. The conventional microwave radar imaging suffers limited range resolution in the sub-millimeter wave range and optical imaging methods are constrained by the diffraction limit. In the terahertz (THz) regime of the spectrum, the SAR systems could be operated in all the weather, all the time and are capable of penetrating through clouds, smoke, dust etc. to achieve high resolution images beyond the diffraction limit. The curved SAR presents a SAR system created by circularly encircling the target scene. The Circular SAR and Spiral SAR which are based on a circular and cylindrical spiral scanning trajectory, respectively are the scanning methods used for curved SAR. In this paper, we have explored a new toolbox that enables the rapid development of near-field THz-SAR imaging systems and generation of large near-field THz imaging scenarios with the goal to support and facilitate data driven research such as deep learning in the THz community through synthetically generated SAR images as well as its potential for THz based high resolution and 2D/3D near-field imaging application. Initially, the potential advantages of THz-SAR over Microwave SAR and optical imaging methods are presented. Further, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar testbed is simulated in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) configuration for the target frequency band. Moreover, the circular and cylindrical SAR scanning methods are explored for near-field imaging of point targets to obtain 2D and 3D THz-SAR images, respectively. Also, the radar images are reconstructed using the Back Propagation and Polar Formatting Algorithms, focusing on short range applications like indoor environments. Finally, the SAR performance evaluation metrics are reported and a roadmap for future work is presented.","1943-0655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2023.3264747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10092939","Synthetic aperture radar (SAR);THz imaging;circular SAR;cylindrical SAR;2D and 3D imaging;near-field;radar image reconstruction;high resolution imaging;reconstruction algorithms;MIMO;FMCW","Imaging;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar imaging;Image resolution;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave imaging;Radar","","12","","80","CCBY","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the types of objects in the coastal zone are complex, and their spectra, textures, shapes, and distribution features are different. Therefore, sea–land segmentation for various types of coastlines is still a challenging task. In this article, a scale-adaptive semantic segmentation network, called SANet, is proposed for sea–land segmentation of remote sensing images. SANet has made two innovations on the basis of the classic encoder–decoder structure. First, to integrate the spectral, textural, and semantic features of ground objects at different scales, we designed an adaptive multiscale feature learning module (AML) to replace the conventional serial convolution operation. The AML module mainly contains a multiscale feature extraction unit and an adaptive feature fusion unit. The former can capture the multiscale detailed information and contextual semantic information of objects from an early stage, while the latter can adaptively fuse feature maps of different scales. Second, we adopted the squeeze-and-excitation module to bridge the corresponding layers of the codec so that SANet can selectively emphasize the features of the weak sea–land boundaries. Experiments on a set of Gaofen-1 remote sensing images demonstrated that SANet achieved more accurate segmentation results and obtained sharper boundaries than other methods for various natural and artificial coastlines.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3040176","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2017YFC1405600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41 406 200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9269403","Adaptive learning;atrous convolution;remote sensing image;residual block;sea–land segmentation;squeeze-excitation module","Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Semantics;Convolution;Task analysis;Remote sensing;Adaptation models","","38","","42","CCBY","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model includes such a lidar simulator. Although already tested on several virtual scenes, the DART outputs still need to be rigorously evaluated against actual sensor acquisitions, especially on real complex scenes of various forest types, such as dense tropical forests. That is the purpose of the present study. A real airborne laser scanner (ALS) with full-waveform capacity was first radiometrically calibrated on targets of measured reflectance. The properties of the ALS system were then introduced in the DART model, along with a 3-D virtual scene built from terrestrial laser scans and spectroscopic measurements acquired on a forest plot near the calibration site. Finally, an ALS acquisition was simulated and the shape and magnitude of the waveforms were compared with real acquisitions. The comparison between measured and simulated data was performed at different scales by aggregating waveform samples into a 3-D grid with a vertical resolution of 1 m and a horizontal resolution ranging from 2 to 80 m. Results showed a high similarity between simulated and measured waveforms at all scales with R2>0.9 and NRMSE<10%.

This study proposes methods named Frequency Component Modification (FCM) and Frequency Component Modification and Mixing (FCMM) to address this gap, as data augmentation techniques in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data. Drawing inspiration from the human vision system’s robustness and frequency spectrum distribution, FCM is successfully developed to introduce larger perturbations to high-frequency components while applying smaller variations to low-frequency components. In addition, FCMM mixes the images generated by FCM, providing diversity at low frequencies and improving the model’s robustness against low-frequency changes. Experimental results demonstrate that FCMM achieves a 1.4%p reduction in mean corruption error (mCE) on both CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C, and 1.3%p on ImageNet-C compared to PixMix, which uses additional data. Moreover, when combined with DeepAugment (DA), the leading state-of-the-art (SOTA) method in corruption robustness that requires additional networks for augmentations, FCMM achieves an mCE of 57.2% on ImageNet-C, improving upon DA’s standalone performance of 62.0% mCE.

The ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) can obtain daily near-global TCWV observations using the visible spectra. The observational accuracy of OMI-estimated TCWV under cloudy-sky conditions is much poorer than OMI-measured clear-sky TCWV. Satellite-based OMI-derived TCWV data, observed with little cloud contamination, are solely used, which, in general, are limited and discontinuous observations. We propose a practical machine learning-based TCWV retrieval algorithm to derive TCWV over land from OMI visible observations under all weather conditions, considering multiple dependable factors linked with OMI TCWV and air mass factor. The global TCWV data, observed from 6000 global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based training stations in 2017, are utilized as the expected TCWV estimates in the algorithm training process. The retrieval approach is validated in 2018–2020 across the world using ground-based TCWV from additional 4,465 GNSS-based verification stations and 783 radiosonde-based verification stations. The newly retrieved TCWV estimates remarkably outperform operational OMI-retrieved water vapor data, regardless of cloud fraction and TCWV levels. In terms of root-mean-square error, it is overall reduced by 90.44% from 56.38 to 5.39 mm and 90.19% from 53.23 to 5.22 mm compared with GNSS and radiosonde TCWV, respectively.

During the inference process, BABE utilizes a generalized version of diffusion posterior sampling, where the degradation operator is unknown but parametrized and inferred iteratively. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using objective and subjective metrics, and the results show that BABE surpasses state-of-the-art blind bandwidth extension baselines and achieves competitive performance compared to informed methods when tested with synthetic data. Moreover, BABE exhibits robust generalization capabilities when enhancing real historical recordings, effectively reconstructing the missing high-frequency content while maintaining coherence with the original recording. Subjective preference tests confirm that BABE significantly improves the audio quality of historical music recordings.

In addition, attention mechanism is widely embedded in these models due to the effective enhancement of features learning. However, it is difficult to learn adaptive weights that effectively enhance features and most of existing methods lack transitional processing of shallow features. To overcome the above issues, a lightweight spectral–spatial score fusion attention network (S3FAN) with dual architecture is proposed for HSI classification with limited samples. Different from the regular dual branch models, S3FAN first performs pixel-level interaction and spatial feature extraction, then the obtained two sets of features are weighted and fused. In addition, we designed a spectral–spatial score fusion attention mechanism to enhance dynamic attention to spectral–spatial features. We also propose a spectral transition block to enhance model adaptability. Performance evaluation experiments conducted on five HSI datasets demonstrate that S3FAN has higher accuracy and generalization capabilities compared to existing advanced CNN and Transformer-based methods, with improvements in terms of OA around 3.18%–34.3% for Indian Pines, 5.87%–28.58% for University of Pavia, 2.57%–15.37% for Salinas, 1.64%–8.95% for Yellow River Delta, 2.87%–11.33% for WHU-Hi-LongKou, under ten samples per class.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3440254","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42271324); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20221506); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10631684","Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification;limited samples;spectral–spatial attention (SSA);transformer","Feature extraction;Transformers;Convolutional neural networks;Attention mechanisms;Adaptation models;Training;Hyperspectral imaging","","","","84","CCBYNCND","8 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To mitigate this problem, an approach is proposed to identify the electromagnetic emission source frequencies and nonlinear factors from the output spectrum of nonlinear circuits. The amplitude of the output spectrum with the input of two sine signals is first calculated based on the power series. Then, the Order Image (OI) is defined to reveal the output spectrum features, and its symmetry characteristic has been comprehensively analyzed. Results show that the maximum symmetry index is observed when the reference frequencies are equal to the excitation frequencies. Based on this observation, the electromagnetic emission source frequencies can be obtained. In addition, a Backward Algorithm (BA) has been introduced to extract nonlinear factors. The proposed approach only requires the output spectrum and the amplitude of one excitation. Compared with other techniques, like the Support Vector Machines and the Recurrent Neural Network, it needs much less prior information. Finally, several examples are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that the emission source frequencies and nonlinear factors can be accurately extracted.

The idea behind developing such a topology is to have the response quite close to that from a real asset while keeping it computationally efficient. The aim is to develop an accurate and efficient model, akin to digital twins, which have the potential for real-time operation. Therefore, the model is divided into two parts. One is a physics-based model that takes fundamental equations and motor construction parameters to yield an intermediate response. All the major parameters are taken into account such that the fundamental component comes quite close to that of the real asset and the bearing fault signature comes in the same order. These signatures are quite small and some small parasitic effects or the assumptions taken while simplifying the model might not impact the fundamental component that much but they alter the signature's amplitude quite significantly. One way is to model all the parasitic effects, which might increase the computation effort significantly. Another way is to take all the parasitic effects altogether and bridge the difference using a statistical approach which is developed using experimental data. Therefore, the current measurements were taken for several bearings with different fault severity. These measurements are processed and quantified such that the net outcome can express the evolution of the signature with increasing fault severity. The same is done for the data generated using the physics-based model. Finally, the difference in the responses is reduced using the neural network such that it can mimic real-world machine behavior closely. The analytical model followed by statistical adjustment overall is considered a hybrid model. The ultimate goal of this methodology is to generate extensive datasets encompassing diverse operating conditions that can be used further to estimate the health of the bearing and possibly be used for training predictive algorithms to estimate bearing RUL in motors. The proposed methodology is developed for the machine operating at 1000 and 1500 RPM and is validated for three different operating speeds.","2644-1284","","10.1109/OJIES.2024.3461949","Flanders Make, Leuven, Belgium; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10681032","Bearing faults;diagnostics;induction motor;motor current signature analysis","Circuit faults;Computational modeling;Mathematical models;Current measurement;Atmospheric modeling;Air gaps;Vibrations;Current measurement;Induction machines","","","","31","CCBYNCND","16 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is common to perform the extraction in frequency-domain, and reconstruct the time-domain signal from the extracted magnitude and estimated phase spectra. However, such an approach is adversely affected by the inherent difficulty of phase estimation. Inspired by Conv-TasNet, we propose a time-domain speaker extraction network (SpEx) that converts the mixture speech into multi-scale embedding coefficients instead of decomposing the speech signal into magnitude and phase spectra. In this way, we avoid phase estimation. The SpEx network consists of four network components, namely speaker encoder, speech encoder, speaker extractor, and speech decoder. Specifically, the speech encoder converts the mixture speech into multi-scale embedding coefficients, the speaker encoder learns to represent the target speaker with a speaker embedding. The speaker extractor takes the multi-scale embedding coefficients and target speaker embedding as input and estimates a receptive mask. Finally, the speech decoder reconstructs the target speaker's speech from the masked embedding coefficients. We also propose a multi-task learning framework and a multi-scale embedding implementation. Experimental results show that the proposed SpEx achieves 37.3%, 37.7% and 15.0% relative improvements over the best baseline in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), scale-invariant SDR (SI-SDR), and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) under an open evaluation condition.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2020.2987429","National Research Foundation Singapore(grant numbers:AISG-100E-2018-006); Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering, Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 Programmatic Fund(grant numbers:A1687b0033); U Bremen Excellence Chairs Program, Germany; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9067003","Time-domain;speaker extraction;depth-wise separable convolution;multi-scale;multi-task learning","Time-domain analysis;Speech processing;Feature extraction;Decoding;Training;Data mining;Frequency-domain analysis","","102","","86","CCBY","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Encoding high-dimensional hyperspectral data into a low-dimensional latent space to generate reasonable abundances, autoencoder (AE) has shown its great potential and attractive advantages in spectral unmixing. AEs decode abundances back to spectra, which can effectively reflect the general spectral mixing process. However, most existing AE-based unmixing methods often do not fully exploit the spatial information of hyperspectral images, hindering the improvement of unmixing accuracy. This article proposes a graph attention convolutional autoencoder architecture for hyperspectral unmixing. By incorporating graph attention convolution into AE, the proposed method performs better in leveraging both long-range and short-range spatial information of hyperspectral images. Accurate abundances with global and local spatial consistency can be efficiently learned by the network. Moreover, the decoder is further improved based on the postpolynomial nonlinear mixing model to make the network have stronger physical interpretability to deal with the issue of nonlinear blind unmixing. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method has good unmixing performance. It can reduce the root mean squared error of estimated abundances for synthetic data by over 10% compared to other methods. In experiments with real hyperspectral data, the difference between its unmixing results’ accuracy and the best is less than 5%.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3308037","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:23ZR1402400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62001098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10229311","Autoencoder;bilinear mixture model;graph attention convolutional network;hyperspectral remote sensing imagery;nonlinear spectral unmixing","Hyperspectral imaging;Convolution;Feature extraction;Decoding;Mixture models;Mathematical models;Convolutional neural networks","","6","","63","CCBYNCND","24 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of the traditional methods of target sensing using spectral information treat hyperspectral image as 2-D matrix regardless of the structure information of hyperspectral image, resulting in insufficient separation of target and background and limited detection accuracy. In order to better utilize the hyperspectral intrinsic structural information, this article proposes a hyperspectral target sensing approach based on tensor adaptive reconstruction cascaded with global and local feature fusion (TRGLF). First, the Tucker decomposition and reconstruction method is utilized to alleviate the influence of noise and other elements in the complex background hyperspectral, which can maintain the intrinsic structural features of the data and improve the background and target separation. The principal components of the factor matrix are determined by a logarithmic singular value summation strategy, and then the energy difference between the spectra to be measured and the previous spectra is calculated to fine-tune the principal components and obtain more appropriate principal component values. Second, on the basis of reconstructed data, a global and local spatial spectral fusion method is adopted to obtain the target of interest. This includes using globally constrained energy minimization to obtain the target of interest and using local differential sensing to further obtain the target boundary. The detection performed on four realistically acquired hyperspectral water surface datasets demonstrate the excellent detection performance of the proposed target detection method.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3486774","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023M740240); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62401062); State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Green Vehicle and Mobility(grant numbers:KFY2416); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62222102,62171023); Fun-damental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:FRF-TP-22-005C1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10736511","Hyperspectral images;hyperspectral target detection;remote sensing;spatial spectral fusion;tensor adaptive reconstruction","Hyperspectral imaging;Object detection;Tensors;Feature extraction;Minimization;Image reconstruction;Sensors;Detectors;Image edge detection;Accuracy","","3","","57","CCBYNCND","28 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, dialysis access stenosis and further dysfunction are engendered by thrombosis or outflow (venous anastomosis site) stenosis and the progression of inflow (arterial anastomosis site) stenosis. Thus, any narrowed access causes vibrations, turbulent flow, and murmur sounds around stenosis sites. Auscultation and frequency-based techniques are employed to detect these sounds, and frequency components are also validated on the basis of the degree of stenosis (DOS). In this paper, a biophysical experimental model employing an in vitro arteriovenous graft model was established to produce various acoustic signals associated with single stenosis and multiple stenoses. By analyzing various combinations of stenoses, this paper selected suitable features of the frequency and power spectra using the Burg autoregressive method. A multiple regression model applying a higher number of explanatory variables and response variables, as a generalized regression neural network, was employed to identify DOS levels at inflow and outflow sites.

Even though WaveNet is capable of producing natural speech waveforms when fed with natural speech features, it still suffers from speech quality degradation when fed with oversmoothed features, such as spectral parameters estimated from a statistical model. One way to address this problem is to introduce oversmoothed features while developing a WaveNet model. However, in a VC framework, providing oversmoothed spectral features of a target speaker for WaveNet modeling is not straightforward owing to the difference in the time-sequence alignment from that of a source speaker. To overcome this problem, we propose the use of a cyclic spectral conversion network, i.e., CycleRNN, capable of performing a conversion flow, i.e., source-to-target, and a cyclic flow, i.e., to generate self-predicted target spectra. The CycleRNN spectral model is trained using both conversion and weighted cyclic losses. To finely tune WaveNet, a pretrained multispeaker WaveNet model is optimized using the self-predicted features of the corresponding target speaker of a speaker conversion pair. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) the proposed CycleRNN-based spectral model for WaveNet fine-tuning significantly improves the naturalness of the converted speech waveforms, giving an overall mean opinion score of 3.50; and 2) the proposed model yields the highest speaker conversion accuracy, giving an overall speaker similarity score of 78.33%, which is a significant improvement compared with conventional WaveNet fine-tuning using natural target features.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2955978","Japan Science and Technology Agency; Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology(grant numbers:JPMJPR1657); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:JP17H06101); JST CREST [https://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/about/](grant numbers:JPMJCR19A3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8913551","Cyclic mapping flow;oversmoothed spectral features;recurrent neural network;spectral mapping;voice conversion;WaveNet fine-tuning;WaveNet vocoder","Vocoders;Feature extraction;Recurrent neural networks;Natural languages;Training;Convolution;Production","","5","","47","CCBY","26 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While persistent pain has been linked to changes in brain activity, studies have focused mainly on acute and chronic phases, leaving neural changes during the subacute phase—especially during movement—under-researched. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate changes in brain activity and the impact of pain intensity in individuals with sLBP during rest and reaching movements. Using a 28-electrode EEG, we measured motor-related brain waves, including theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations. Transitioning from rest to movement phases resulted in significant reductions (>80%) in mean power across all frequency bands, indicating dynamic brain activation in response to movement. Furthermore, pain intensity was significantly correlated with brain wave activity. During rest, pain intensity was positively correlated with alpha oscillation activity in the central brain area (r = 0.40, p <0.05). In contrast, during movement, pain intensity was negatively correlated with changes in brain activity (r = −0.36 to −0.40, p <0.05). These findings suggest that pain influences brain activity differently during rest and movement, underscoring the impact of pain levels on neural networks related to the sensorimotor system in sLBP and highlighting the importance of understanding neural changes during this critical transitional phase.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3521286","Cheng Hsin General Hospital(grant numbers:CY11211); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10811937","Electroencephalography (EEG);low back pain;reaching task","Pain;Brain;Electroencephalography;Motors;Back;Oscillators;History;Hospitals;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Electrodes","","","","58","CCBYNCND","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The daily usage of induction motors creates the demand for proper maintenance and slight fault detection to avoid serious damage to the induction motor and the shutdown of industries. Among the various kinds of faults in induction motors, bearing faults, broken rotor bar faults, and short-circuit insulation faults are the most common. Thus, detection and classification of these faults in initial stage are attracting great attention. There are conventional methods for detecting such faults, such as the vibration method for bearing faults, the self-organizing map in the case of broken rotor bar faults, and motor current signature analysis for short-circuit insulation faults. From an industrial point of view, diagnosis methods that can classify all these major faults are required. However, reports on the detection and classification of these faults in initial stage using common diagnosis methods are scarce. In this paper, all three kinds of notable faults in an induction motor were artificially induced, and diagnoses using motor stator current spectral features and the rotation speed of the motor were performed. The diagnosis was accomplished using an auto-tunable and arbitrary featured support vector machine algorithm. Although the faults were minor, a high accuracy rate was obtained. The capability to classify the faults and the high diagnosis accuracy prove the robustness and high sensitivity of the method, enabling its practical applications in industries.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3254914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064256","Bearing fault;diagnosis;insulation fault;rotor bar fault;induction motor;support vector machine","Circuit faults;Rotors;Induction motors;Bars;Support vector machines;Fault diagnosis;Windings","","21","","42","CCBYNCND","9 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed “Proof-of-Sense” consensus mechanism operates based on spectrum sensing procedures rather than cryptographic calculations. It is specially designed to address fraudulent/unauthorized access to the spectrum by analyzing the sensed spectrum data.

To address this critical issue, an ultrafast and accurate SoH monitoring is proposed in this paper. The proposed variable forgetting factor Recursive Least Squares (VFFRLS) method is designed based on a least square method with forgetting factors to determine the electrical parameters of a simple electrical model. The established electrical model can be easily implemented using cost-effective micro-controller units (MCUs). The weighting factors of the objective function is automatically determined based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Experimental results validate the superior performance of the proposed strategy over conventional methods in detecting the SoH of one new and three aged batteries.

However, CNN can only perform convolution calculations on Euclidean datasets. To solve this problem, recently, the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) is proposed, which can be applied to the semisupervised HSI classification problem. However, the GCN is a direct push learning method, which requires all nodes to participate in the training process to get the node embedding. This may bring great computational cost for the hyperspectral data with a large number of pixels. Therefore, in this article, we propose an inductive learning method to solve the problem. It constructs the graph by sampling and aggregating (GraphSAGE) feature from a node's local neighborhood. This could greatly reduce the space complexity. Moreover, to enhance the classification performance, we also construct the graph using spectral and spatial information (spectra-spatial GraphSAGE). Experiments on several hyperspectral image datasets show that the proposed method can achieve better classification performance compared with state-of-the-art HSI classification methods.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3042959","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61 701 009); Beijing Municipal Education Commission Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:KM202010005016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9286488","GraphSAGE;hyperspectral image classification;inductive learning method;spectral and spatial","Hyperspectral imaging;Aggregates;Feature extraction;Learning systems;Training;Convolution;Support vector machines","","23","","43","CCBY","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One potential solution is to deploy the fog computing servers geographically closer to the vehicles to serve the vehicle-based applications in real time. However, due to the constraint of caching storage space as well as lack of tractable access mode selection and spectrum allocation algorithm, it is very challenging to balance the network transmission performance and fronthaul savings. In this paper, we investigate the joint optimization problem of access mode selection and spectrum allocation in fog computing-based vehicular networks. To solve the problem in an efficient way, the original high complexity optimization problem is divided into two subproblems. Wherein, the vehicle access mode selection problem is solved by Q-learning-based algorithm by considering spectrum allocation profiles and the fronthaul link cost. The randomly vehicular network topologies are modeled as CoX processes and the closed-form payoff expressions are derived by the stochastic geometry tools. On the other hand, the optimal spectrum allocation indicator value can be finally obtained via convex optimization. The analytical results for the proposed algorithm as well as the traditional baseline approaches are evaluated with different weight factors, which verify our theoretical analysis and confirm the proposed approach can achieve significant performance gains.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2895626","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M641279); State Major Science and Technology Special Projects(grant numbers:2017ZX03001014,2018ZX03001025); Southeast University(grant numbers:2019D01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629049","Fog computing;access mode selection;performance analysis;spectrum allocation;machine learning","Resource management;Edge computing;Roads;Downlink;Bandwidth;Optimization;Reliability","","23","","32","OAPA","29 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we collected bituminous coal and lignite from the Shenhua opencast coal mine in China in addition to non-coal objects, including sandstones, soils, shales, marls, vegetation, coal gangues, water, and buildings.

Totally an AE performs well in hyperspectral unmixing through automatically learning low-dimensional embedding and reconstructing data. However, most available AE-based hyperspectral unmixing networks do not fully consider the spatial and spectral information of different ground features in hyperspectral images and output relatively fixed ratios of linear and nonlinear photon scattering effects under different scenarios. Therefore, these methods have poor generalization abilities across different ground features and scenarios. Here, inspired by the two-stream network structure, we propose a spatial–spectral adaptive nonlinear unmixing network (SSANU-Net) in which the spatial–spectral information of hyperspectral imagery is effectively learned using the two-stream encoder, followed by the simulation of the linear–nonlinear scattering component of photons using a two-stream decoder. Additionally, we adopt a combination of spatial–spectral and linear–nonlinear components using the optimized adaptive weighting strategy of learnable parameters. Experiments with several hyperspectral image datasets (i.e., Samson, Jasper Ridge, and Urban) showed that the proposed SSANU-Net network had higher unmixing accuracy and generalization performance compared with several conventional methods. This demonstrates that SSANU-Net represents a novel method for hyperspectral unmixing analysis.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3323748","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42171327); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10278425","Adaptive weighting;autoencoder (AE);hyperspectral imagery;nonlinear mixing;spatial–spectral adaptive nonlinear unmixing network (SSANU-Net)","Hyperspectral imaging;Photonics;Decoding;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Adaptive systems;Scattering","","5","","53","CCBYNCND","11 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these accuracy improvements come at the cost of significant demands on storage resources, computational overhead, and extensive training samples. To address these challenges, this article proposes a multiscale spatial–spectral shuffling convolution integrated with a 3-D lightweight transformer (MSC-3DLT) for HSI classification. This network directly captures 3-D structural features throughout the entire feature extraction process, thereby enhancing HSI classification performance even at small sampling rates within a lightweight framework. Specifically, we first design a multiscale spatial–spectral shuffling convolution to comprehensively refine spatial–spectral feature granularities and enhance feature interactions by shuffling multiscale features across different groups. Second, to maximize the exploitation of limited training samples, we rethink transformers from the 3-D structural perspective of HSI data and propose a novel 3-D lightweight transformer (3DLT). Different from the slicing operation employed in classical transformers, the 3DLT directly extracts the inherent 3-D structural features from the HSI and mitigates quadratic complexity through a lightweight spatial–spectral pooling cross-attention mechanism. Finally, a novel training strategy is designed to adaptively adjust the learning rate based on multimetric feedback during the model training process, significantly accelerating the model fitting speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MSC-3DLT method remains highly competitive compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy, model parameters, and floating point and operations under small sampling rates.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3533211","Young Backbone Teacher Training Program of Henan Province(grant numbers:2023GGJS090); Scientific and Technological Research Project of Henan Provincial Department of Science and Technology(grant numbers:242102210013,242102210017,232102211048); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502435,62476255); Key Scientific Research Projects of Colleges in Henan Province(grant numbers:23A520001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10850760","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);hyperspectral image (HSI) classification;multimetric adaptive learning rate (MALR);3-D lightweight transformer (3DLT)","Feature extraction;Transformers;Convolution;Data mining;Training;Three-dimensional displays;Complexity theory;Mathematical models;Kernel;Adaptation models","","","","65","CCBY","23 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The research meticulously interrogates this pivotal concern, endeavoring to harmonize multiple design objectives that traditionally exist in tension. Leveraging the robust computational prowess of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) for multiobjective optimization, this study orchestrates a deliberate foray into the expansive and complex design space. The overarching aim is not merely to pinpoint a singular, universal design zenith, but to painstakingly chart a continuum of Pareto-optimal solutions, thereby accommodating the myriad, often contradictory, imperatives that animate robotic design—from the quest for energy efficiency to the pursuit of agility, speed, and robust structural integrity. This methodology yields a rich tapestry of insights: notable among them is the discernible predilection of specific linkage configurations towards distinct performance outcomes. While certain geometries resonate more profoundly with rapid, fluid motion, others evince a marked inclination towards stability or frugal energy consumption. By dissecting these intricate relationships, and presenting them within a structured framework, this study contributes profoundly to the literature, offering both theoretical depth and pragmatic design templates to the robotics community. This synergistic marriage of computational algorithms with nuanced design challenges holds the promise to significantly recalibrate and enhance contemporary paradigms in leg linkage design for horizontally propelling robots. This study marks a significant advancement in robotic locomotion by employing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) for the first time in the optimization of leg linkage design for walking robots, providing a more nuanced understanding of the balance between structural integrity, energy efficiency, and propulsion agility. Our research elucidates a spectrum of Pareto-optimal solutions, a novel approach that offers a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs involved in leg linkage design. Specifically, the optimized designs achieved an improvement in propulsion efficiency by reducing the approximation error to less than 0.006, and enhancing force transmission angles to over 25 degrees. These experimental results validate the practical applicability of these designs, demonstrating a balance of improved efficiency and stability, thereby setting a new benchmark for leg linkage design in walking robots. The findings underscore the potential of NSGA in robotic design, offering a robust framework for future advancements in the field.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3354384","Development of Deep Learning Methods and Intellectual Analysis for Solving Complex Problems of Mechanics and Robotics(grant numbers:BR18574136); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10400469","Walking robot;multiobjective optimization;genetic algorithm;evolutionary algorithm;NSGA;non-dominated sorting","Legged locomotion;Robots;Couplings;Robot kinematics;Optimization;Genetic algorithms;Propulsion;Sorting","","","","79","CCBYNCND","15 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, pixel-level manual annotation is time-consuming and laborious, and the small amount of labeled HSI data brings challenges to deep learning methods. Existing methods use carefully designed network architectures combined with self-supervised or semi-supervised learning to deal with the lack of training samples. Those methods were designed for specific datasets and often needed to tune hyperparameters on new datasets carefully. To tackle this problem, a unified HSI masked autoencoder framework was proposed for HSI classification. Different from existing works, the hyperspectral image masked autoencoder (HSIMAE) framework was pretrained on a large-scale unlabeled HSI dataset, named HSIHybrid, which contained a large amount of HSI data acquired by different sensors. First, to handle the different spectral ranges of HSIs, a group-wise PCA was applied to extract features of HSI spectra and transform them into fixed-length vectors. Then, a modified masked autoencoder was proposed for large-scale pretraining. It utilized separate spatial–spectral encoders followed by fusion blocks to learn spatial correlation and spectral correlation of HSI data. Finally, to leverage the unlabeled data of the target dataset, a dual-branch finetuning framework that used an extra unlabeled branch for mask modeling learning was introduced. Extensive experiments were conducted on four HSI datasets from different hyperspectral sensors. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HSIMAE framework over the state-of-the-art methods, even with very few training samples.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3432743","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFF0906702); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:22273120); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10607879","Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification;large-scale pretraining;masked autoencoder;self-supervised learning;transformer","Feature extraction;Transformers;Hyperspectral imaging;Principal component analysis;Data models;Training;Imaging","","4","","78","CCBYNCND","23 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our method consists of an SSL model and a DT model. The SSL model predicts the position of a sound source inside the structure, whereas the DT model transforms the data. Because our simulation is not perfect, real data are extrapolated for use with the SSL model. However, the data transformed by the DT model are interpolated within the feature space. The outcome is that the performance of the SSL model in the real world is improved. In our study, the frequency spectra of accelerometers observed on the outer surface of the structure are the model input. The goal is to predict the position of the sound source. The SSL model is built using deep and convolutional neural networks, and the DT model is built using either an autoencoder, a deep convolutional autoencoder, or pix2pix. The two-dimensional distributions of the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding indicate that using pix2pix as the DT model shows the best performance.

Traditional methods for remote sensing data reconstruction include spectral-based, spatial-based, time-based, and hybrid-based methods. However, these methods have inherent limitations in handling cloud removal due to the imaging mechanism of optical images. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images have been used in remote sensing image de-clouding in recent years due to their unique imaging mechanism. However, the domain gap between SAR images and multispectral images, the nonuniformity of cloud distribution, and the lack of mining self-similarity and correlation between different spectra of multispectral images pose challenges for SAR-based cloud removal. In this study, we propose a SAR-based cross-attention network for multispectral image de-clouding reconstruction. The cross-attention mechanism helps regions with heavy cloud cover to refer more to the features of SAR images during reconstruction while avoiding interference from the noise interference of SAR images. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and visual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for cloud removal in remote sensing.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3538316","Research and Application of Key Technologies for Enhancing the Environmental Quality of Livable Cities(grant numbers:2023YFC3805305); Shanghai Pujiang Program(grant numbers:23PJ1412700); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project(grant numbers:2021SHZDZX0100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10870427","Cloud removal;Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR);transformer;image fusion;cross-attention","Image reconstruction;Radar polarimetry;Transformers;Synthetic aperture radar;Remote sensing;Imaging;Surface reconstruction;Feature extraction;Optical sensors;Optical imaging","","","","44","CCBY","4 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study focuses on creating automatic lymph node annotation in MRI images using available CT annotations via deep-learning models. Training such models typically requires partial MRI labels for semi-supervision. However, annotating lymph nodes in MRI images is particularly challenging due to their small size and the high cost of MRI scans. These factors make it difficult to create labeled MRI datasets for deep learning model training. Moreover, existing cross-modal annotation methods primarily focus on large tumors and require large datasets, making them unsuitable for small lymph nodes with less training data. We address these challenges using cross-modal supervision through image registration. Our algorithm reduces the burden of manual annotation and the reliance on large labeled datasets and eliminates the need for any MRI ground truth. The algorithm has three steps: 1) unsupervised deformable image translation-based registration of MRI to CT image, producing registered MRI; 2) annotating lymph nodes in registered MRI with the available CT labels; and 3) deregistration of registered annotated MRI back to the original shape of MRI. The translation-based registration model for the algorithm’s first and third steps uses a discriminator-free StyleGAN2 translation network and a deformable image registration network with a U-Net-inspired architecture. This registration network includes local and global feature extraction modules, a local-global spatial correlation module, and a superresolution loss function. Our approach eliminates the need for MRI labels by registering MRI with CT images. Experiments show 2.19% and 4.08% MSE reductions, 5.40% and 3.28% SSIM improvements, 29.85% and 3.82% NCC increases for cross-modality and mono-modality registration, respectively, along with a 36.7% training speedup over state-of-the-art translation-based registration models.

The loss of the traditional unmixing algorithm based on deep learning typically depends on reducing the discrepancy between the original and reconstructed hyperspectral image. However, during the training process, the loss feedback method is relatively simple, resulting highly random unmixing results. Moreover, spatial feature extraction can effectively improve the unmixing effect, but existing spatial feature extraction methods in hyperspectral unmixing still have significant room for improvement. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial autoencoder unmixing network considering pixel-level and global similarity measurements based on a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) and a U-shaped transformer-enhanced architecture. The WGAN ensures stable gradient updates through a gradient penalty, maintaining Lipschitz continuity, while the U-shaped network with Swin transformer blocks captures both local and global spatial features. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and real-world hyperspectral datasets. Our method outperformed state-of-the-art approaches, achieving improvement in root mean square error and spectral angle distance (SAD). The SAD is a metric that quantifies the angular difference between the true and estimated endmember spectra, our method improves the mean SAD by at least 8.7% compared to competing algorithms, representing an enhancement in unmixing performance. Notably, the method demonstrated superior robustness in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios, maintaining high unmixing accuracy.

While IVA performs a time-invariant bijective linear transformation, NF-IVA performs a series of time-varying bijective linear transformations (flow blocks) adaptively predicted by neural networks. To regularize such transformations, we introduce a soft volume-preserving (VP) constraint.

First, the original hyperspectral spectra are transformed to a normalized spectra, in which a modified continuum removal algorithm is adopted to highlight all spectral valleys. Next, a standard peak detection method is applied to the continuum-removed spectra, and all effective absorptions are found as the candidate features. Then, to obtain the most informative absorptions to classification, a novel mutual-information based feature selection method is used to search for the key absorption spectra. Finally, we put forward a matching algorithm to classify the absorption features using the multi-label learning.

Meanwhile, as the rolling bearing works in the normal state at most times, it is easy to raise the imbalance problem of fault types which restricts the diagnosis accuracy and stability. To solve these problems, we present an imbalanced fault diagnosis method based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) and provide a comparative study in detail. The key idea is utilizing GAN, a kind of deep learning technique, to generate synthetic samples for minority fault class and then improve the generalization ability of the fault diagnosis model. First, this method applies fast Fourier transform to pre-process the original vibration signal and then obtains the frequency spectrum of fault samples. Second, it uses the spectrum data as the input of GAN to generate the synthetic minority samples following the data distribution of the real samples. Finally, it puts the synthetic samples into the training set and builds a stacked denoising auto encoder model for fault diagnosis. To testify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of comparative experiments is carried out on the CWRU bearing dataset. The results show that the proposed method can provide a better solution for imbalanced fault diagnosis on the basis of generating similar fault samples. As a comparative study, the proposed method is compared to several diagnostic methods with traditional time-frequency domain characteristics.

However, their detection performance is still unsatisfactory due to the independent manner of the recovery process on each test pixel. Moreover, the background dictionary generated through the dual windows is susceptible to target contamination. Aiming to address these issues, in this article, we propose a decomposition model (DM) with background dictionary learning (BDL) for hyperspectral target detection. The observed data are decomposed into three parts: background, target, and noise. The background and target dictionaries are utilized to represent the background and target components, respectively. In order to achieve a satisfactory recovery of the background and target components, the proposed DM exploits the spatial smoothness of background pixels and the scarcity of the targets of interest in the whole scene via the total variation and the sparsity, respectively. Then, the separated target image is directly used for the detection purpose. Furthermore, a novel BDL method based on the locality-constrained linear coding is presented, and a complete and compact background dictionary can be learned with a low computational cost. Meanwhile, the a priori target dictionary is also incorporated into the learning process in order to suppress the contamination of the target signal on the learned background spectra.

Nonetheless, the wave spectra developed by researchers fall short of the standards set by remote sensing specialists, mainly due to the limitation of capturing the surface roughness influenced by both short and long waves, prompting ongoing efforts to develop a model covering a diverse scale of wavenumbers in the absence of a generally recognized reference formula. In response, a standard two-scale formulation of wave frequency spectra (WFS) was introduced, where wave height and spectral peak period are determined by sea state. The proposed composite WFS holds the potential to incorporate directional spreading, contributing to the angular distribution of ocean wave energy in the form of directional WFS, making it applicable for ocean modeling. In an effort to investigate directionality effects, an array of well-established spreading functions, including cosine-squared, half-cosine 2s, parameterized half-cosine 2s, hyperbolic secant-squared, and composite structured functions, has been developed here for numerical modeling of random ocean media (ROM) surface roughness and synthesized for their spectral scattering distribution mode, encompassing scattering pattern, scattering orientation, and fractal roughness properties. Nonetheless, the generated ROM models, each varying due to inherent limitations in directional WFS formulation and numerical approximations, demonstrate indeterminacy and unpredictability in surface features, posing challenges for accurately synthesizing ROM roughness patterns. These challenges intensify under varying sea states and different directional WFS formulas, leading to a situation where no single synthesized composite ROM model consistently outperforms the others, rendering them imprecise frameworks for analyzing roughness patterns and investigating texture electromagnetic interactions within the realm of remote sensing. As an approach, a pattern-sensitive fusion method is proposed, employing a multi-scale transform domain (MTD) fusion scheme that leverages the learning potential of a deep super resolution network. The objective is to fuse the reconstructed ROM roughness models, generating an optimal roughness while maintaining their scattering pattern, scattering orientation, and dominant directionality, pivotal for texture consistency and, consequently, the backscattering properties from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) viewpoint. To validate the reliability of ROM modeling and its roughness synthesis, including the texture fusion and raw data generation, a comprehensive objective quality assessment technique is utilized. These assessments demonstrate the complete consistency of the simulation results with the underlying spectral theory, highlighting their potential contribution to projects related to ocean radar probing and remote sensing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3380201","Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) (Study on Remote Sensing for Quantitative Analysis of Changes in the Arctic Cryosphere)(grant numbers:PE24040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10477475","Directional wave frequency spectrum;fractal fusion;random ocean media;sea state;synthetic aperture radar","Read only memory;Scattering;Sea surface;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;Surface waves;Sea state","","2","","152","CCBYNCND","21 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lack of proper sleep can impair functionality and overall health. While stress is known for its detrimental impact on sleep quality, the precise effect of pre-sleep stress on subsequent sleep structure remains unknown. This study introduced a novel approach to study the pre-sleep stress effect on sleep structure, specifically slow-wave sleep (SWS) deficiency. To achieve this, we selected forehead resting EEG immediately before and upon sleep onset to extract stress-related neurological markers through power spectra and entropy analysis. These markers include beta/delta correlation, alpha asymmetry, fuzzy entropy (FuzzEn) and spectral entropy (SpEn). Fifteen subjects were included in this study. Our results showed that subjects lacking SWS often exhibited signs of stress in EEG, such as an increased beta/delta correlation, higher alpha asymmetry, and increased FuzzEn in frontal EEG. Conversely, individuals with ample SWS displayed a weak beta/delta correlation and reduced FuzzEn. Finally, we employed several supervised learning models and found that the selected neurological markers can predict subsequent SWS deficiency. Our investigation demonstrated that the classifiers could effectively predict varying levels of slow-wave sleep (SWS) from pre-sleep EEG segments, achieving a mean balanced accuracy surpassing 0.75.

However, existing research on underwater HTD is limited, as most methods fail to adequately consider the impact of underwater target spectral variability and image quality degradation. To address these critical issues, we propose a novel joint framework for underwater hyperspectral image restoration and target detection, which is based on a conditional diffusion model. Our proposed framework consists of two main modules: the variable spectral group extraction module, and the joint underwater hyperspectral image restoration and target detection (JURTD) module. The variable spectral group extraction module leverages the conditional diffusion model to extract variable spectral image groups, thereby simulating the diverse range of underwater target spectra. Subsequently, the JURTD module extracts deep features from intrinsic images and the group of variable spectral images. Operating under the dual constraints of image restoration and target detection, this module achieves high-quality restored images and superior detection performance concurrently. Experimental evaluations conducted on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in enhancing image quality and improving target detection performance. Moreover, the results indicate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its practical utility and superiority in underwater hyperspectral imaging applications.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3464557","Science and Technology on Electromechanical Dynamic Control Laboratory(grant numbers:614260124020202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10684488","Deep learning;diffusion model;hyperspectral imagery (HSI);underwater image restoration;underwater target detection","Image restoration;Object detection;Feature extraction;Diffusion models;Hyperspectral imaging;Reflectivity;Interference","","1","","46","CCBYNCND","19 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most significant task of AOSLO image dewarping is image registration. Most traditional feature-based registration algorithms used for AOSLO images are based on Gaussian scale space. However, the homogeneous Gaussian blurring reduces the localization accuracy of feature points and the distinctiveness of feature descriptors. In this paper, the accelerated KAZE (AKAZE) feature based on nonlinear scale space was utilized to register AOSLO retinal images for the first time, and an efficient strategy based on matched feature points for frame selection was proposed to automatically accomplish AOSLO retinal image dewarping. Moreover, a flexible method based on power spectra analysis is proposed to study the minimum number of frames needed to accomplish image dewarping. The extensive experiments demonstrated that the AKAZE method is more suitable for AOSLO image dewarping, benefitted with better accuracy, robustness, and rapidity compared with several traditional registration methods based on Gaussian scale space.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914463","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61605210); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFC0102500,2017YFB0403700); National Instrumentation Program (NIP)(grant numbers:2012YQ120080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8705287","Retina image;adaptive optics confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope;image dewarping;image registration;nonlinear scale space;Gaussian scale space","Retina;Optical filters;Filtering;Adaptive optics;Image registration;Mirrors;Imaging","","9","","60","OAPA","3 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the high-speed imaging with rather short exposure time inevitably reduces the signal intensity, and many factors, such as speckle noise and intraocular scatter, further degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of retinal images. To effectively improve the image quality without increasing the LSO system’s complexity, the post-processing method of image super-resolution (SR) is adopted. In this paper, we propose a learning-based multi-frame retinal image SR method that directly learns an end-to-end mapping from low-resolution (LR) image sequences to high-resolution (HR) images. This network was validated on down-sampled and real LSO image sequences. We evaluated the method on a down-sampled dataset with the metrics of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and perceptual distance. Moreover, the power spectra and full width at half maximum (FWHM) were used as the no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) algorithms to evaluate the reconstruction results of the real LSO image sequences. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can significantly enhance the SNR of LSO images and efficiently improve the resolution of LSO retinal images, which has great practical significance for clinical diagnosis and analysis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930329","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFC0108201,2016YFC0102500,2017YFB0403700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61605210,61675226); Frontier Science research project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:QYZDB-SSW-JSC03); Jiangsu Province Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:BK20160010); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDB32000000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8768363","Line-scanning ophthalmoscope;retinal images;multi-frame image super-resolution;learning-based","Retina;Imaging;Spatial resolution;Image sequences;Image reconstruction;Generative adversarial networks","","5","","42","CCBY","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is a lack of data and information regarding their extent and specific locations. This study aims to understand the dynamics of these cropping patterns using hyperspectral satellite data. We examined the spectral reflectance of maize and intercropped maize (imaize) fields using DESIS hyperspectral satellite data during the flowering growth phase for discrimination and classification. We used mean reflectance spectra, coefficient of variation, and the Mann–Whitney U-test to characterize the cropping patterns and identify optimal spectral bands. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperspectral data, followed by RF classification. Our findings reveal that the optimal spectral bands for classification fell within the 730–1000 nm range, with the spectral band at 849.8 nm being the most prominent. The RF algorithm performed well, achieving an overall accuracy of 80%. The maize class was distinguished with high precision (0.9) and recall (0.8), resulting in an F1-score of 0.9, indicating a robust ability to accurately identify and classify most of the maize class. In comparison, the imaize class exhibited lower precision (0.6) but a reasonable recall (0.7), leading to an F1-score of 0.6. These findings highlight the potential of using DESIS hyperspectral satellite data in conjunction with PCA and RF for the classification of maize cropping patterns. Additionally, our findings suggest avenues for further research using full waveform hyperspectral satellite data, such as EnMAP and PRISMA, to enhance our understanding of spectral dynamics among different cropping patterns.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3457791","National Research Foundation of South Africa and Nuffic(grant numbers:120226); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10675363","Cropping patterns;DESIS hyperspectral satellite data;principal component analysis (PCA);random forest (RF) classification","Crops;Hyperspectral imaging;Accuracy;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Radio frequency;Principal component analysis","","","","87","CCBYNCND","10 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, objects with different functional attributes may exhibit similar physical characteristics, resulting in comparable spectral reflectance and visual features. This issue, known as the “different categories with the same spectra” problem, limits the ability to discriminate between objects, thereby increasing the difficulty of differentiation. Studies based on Euclidean space often struggle to distinguish between objects due to the limited information available. To improve differentiation, additional information—such as neighborhood relationships—needs to be incorporated. The geographical scenario, i.e., the environmental context of the object—which includes crucial neighborhood categories and their spatial relationships, provides spatial relationship information for objects. This information provides an important context for object differentiation and becomes the key to distinguishing these similar objects. Following this idea, geographical scenarios are represented as graphs in graph space, with categories as nodes and adjacency relationships as edges, and a geographical knowledge graph is created based on all the scenarios. We convert the remote sensing images into graphs to match with the geographical scenarios and propose a knowledge-based semantic segmentation network for remote sensing, graph structure attention network (GSAN). In GSAN, a graph structure attention (GSAT) is designed based on the graph kernel. This allows it to discern graph structures corresponding to different geographical scenarios. GSAT serves as a link between the fine-grained visual objects and the coarse-grained semantic knowledge. Experiment results indicate that GSAN outperforms other attention networks in semantic segmentation on our sea and land remote sensing (SLRS) dataset. This demonstrates its advantages in geographical scenario recognition and remote sensing semantic segmentation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3521238","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC0810605); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10811991","Geographical scenario;graph kernel;graph structure attention (GSAT);knowledge graph;remote sensing","Kernel;Remote sensing;Knowledge graphs;Semantic segmentation;Semantics;Object recognition;Attention mechanisms;Sensors;Image edge detection;Topology","","","","56","CCBY","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In audio applications, magnitude of time-frequency representation, including spectrogram, is regarded as one of the most important features. Such magnitude-based features have been extensively utilized in learning-based audio processing. Since a logarithmic scale is important in terms of auditory perception, the features are usually computed with a logarithmic function. That is, a logarithmic function is applied within the computation of features so that a learning machine does not have to explicitly model the logarithmic scale. We think in a different way and propose a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that simultaneously models linear- and log-magnitude spectra. RBM is a stochastic neural network that can discover data representations without supervision. To manage both linear and logarithmic scales, we define an energy function based on both scales. This energy function results in a conditional distribution (of the observable data, given hidden units) that is written as the gamma distribution, and hence the proposed RBM is termed gamma-Bernoulli RBM. The proposed gamma-Bernoulli RBM was compared to the ordinary Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM by speech representation experiments. Both objective and subjective evaluations illustrated the advantage of the proposed model.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2021.3095656","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:21K11957); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478208","Boltzmann machine;nonnegative data modeling;gamma distribution;speech parameterization;speech synthesis","Gamma distribution;Training;Time-frequency analysis;Computational modeling;Stacking;Stochastic processes;Probabilistic logic","","3","","47","CCBY","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
